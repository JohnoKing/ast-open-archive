.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sort\^
sorts
lines of all the
.I files
together and writes the result on the standard output.
The name
.B \-
means the standard input.
If no input files are named, the standard input is sorted.
.PP
The default sort key is an entire line.
Default ordering is lexicographic by bytes in machine collating sequence.
The ordering is affected globally by the following options,
one or more of which may appear.
See
.IR librecsort (3)
for details.
.TP
.B \-b
Ignore leading white space (spaces and tabs) in field comparisons.
.TP
.B \-d
`Phone directory' order: only letters, digits and white space
are significant in string comparisons.
.TP
.B \-f
Fold lower case
letters onto upper case.
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore characters outside the
.SM ASCII
range 040-0176
in string comparisons.
.TP
.B \-n
An initial numeric string,
consisting of optional white space, optional sign, and
a nonempty string of digits with optional decimal point,
is sorted by value.
.TP
.B \-g
Numeric, like
.BR \-n ,
with
.BR e -style
exponents allowed.
.TP
.B \-M
Compare as month names.
The first three
characters after optional white space
are folded to lower case and compared.
Invalid fields compare low to
.LR jan .
.TP
.B \-r
Reverse the sense of comparisons.
.TP
.BI \-t x\^
`Tab character' separating fields is
.IR x .
.TP
.BI \-k " pos1" , pos2
Restrict the sort key to a string beginning at
.I pos1\^
and ending at
.IR pos2 .
.I Pos1\^
and
.I pos2\^
each have the form
.IB m . n ,
optionally followed by one or more of the flags
.BR Mbdfginr ;
.I m\^
counts fields from the beginning of the line and
.I n\^
counts characters from the beginning of the field.
If any flags are present they override all the global
ordering options for this key.
If
.BI \&. n\^
is missing from 
.I pos1,
it is taken to be 1; if missing from
.IR pos2, 
it is taken to be the end of the field.
If 
.I pos2
is missing, it is taken to be end of line.
.TP
\fB\-k \fIreclen\fR:[\fIfieldlen\fR:[\fIoffset\fR]]
Specifies fixed length records of
.I reclen
bytes.
.I fieldlen
and
.I offset
optionally specify a fixed field length and offset within the record.
.PP
Under option
.BI \-t x\^
fields are strings separated by
.IR x ;
otherwise fields are
non-empty strings separated by white space.
White space before a field
is part of the field, except under option
.BR \-b .
A
.B b
flag may be attached independently to
.IR pos1
and
.IR pos2.
.PP
When there are multiple sort keys, later keys
are compared only after all earlier keys
compare equal.
Except under option 
.BR \-s ,
lines with all keys equal are ordered
with all bytes significant.
.B \-S
turns off
.BR \-s ,
the last occurrence, left-to-right, takes affect.
.PP
Sorting is done by a method determined by the
.B \-x
option.
.B \-l
lists the available methods.
.I rasp
.RB ( ra dix+ sp lay-tree)
is the default and current all-around best.
.PP
Single-letter options may be combined into a single
string, such as
.BR \-cnrt: .
The option combination
.B \-di
and the combination of
.B \-n
with any of
.BR \-diM 
are improper.
Posix argument conventions are supported.
.PP
These option arguments are also understood:
.TP
.B \-c
Check that the single input file is sorted according to the ordering rules;
give no output unless the file is out of sort.
.TP
.BI \-j " jobs"
Use up to
.I jobs
separate processes to sort the input.
The current implementation still uses one process for the final merge phase;
improvements are planned.
.TP
.B \-m
Merge; the input files are already sorted.
.TP
.B \-u
Unique.  Keep only the first of two lines 
that compare equal on all keys.
Implies
.BR \-s .
.TP
.B \-s
Stable sort.
When all keys compare equal, preserve input order.
This is the default, unless standard conformance is in effect.
See
.IR getconf (1).
.B \-S
forces unstable sort in which the entire record is used to break ties.
.TP
.BI \-o " output
Place output in a designated file
instead of on the standard output.
This file may be the same as one of the inputs.
The option may appear among the
.I file
arguments, except after 
.BR \-\- .
.TP
.BI \-T " tempdir
Put temporary files in
.I tempdir
rather than in (the default)
.BR /usr/tmp .
.TP
.BI \-z " type\|size"
Suggests using the specified number of 
bytes of internal store to tune performance.
Type is a single character and may be one of:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B a
Buffer alignment.
.TP
.B i
Input buffer size.
.TP
.B p
Input sort size; sorting is done in chunks of this size.
.TP
.B o
Output buffer size.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.BI + pos1 " \-" pos2
Classical alternative to
.BR \-k ,
with counting from 0 instead of 1, and
.I pos2
designating next-after-last instead of last character of the key.
A missing character count in
.I pos2
means 0, which in turn excludes any 
.B \-t
tab character from the end of the key.
Thus
.B "+1\ \-1.3"
means the same as 
.B \-k\ 2,2.3
and
.B "+1r\ \-3"
means the same as
.BR "\-k\ 2r,3" .
.PP
Options
.BR \-g ,
.BR \-M ,
.BR \-s ,
.BR \-S ,
.BR \-T ,
and
.BR \-z 
are not in the Posix standard.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.L sort \-u \-k1f \-k1 list
Print in alphabetical order all the unique spellings
in a list of words
where capitalized words differ from uncapitalized.
.TP
.L sort \-t: \-k3n /etc/passwd
Print the password file
.RI ( passwd (5))
sorted by userid
(the third colon-separated field).
.TP
.L sort \-umM dates
Print the first instance of each month in an already sorted file.

.IR join (1),
.IR uniq (1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.I Sort
comments and exits with non-zero status for various trouble
conditions and for disorder discovered under option
.BR \-c .
.SH BUGS
The never-documented default
.IR pos1 =0
for cases such as
.B sort \-1
has been abolished.
.br
An input file overwritten by 
.BR \-o 
is not replaced until the entire output file is generated in the same
directory as the input, at which point the input is renamed.
