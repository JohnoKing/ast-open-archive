This is NOT a general purpose cabinet library with a front end tacked
on. If you want a comprehensive library to read and write cabinet
files, please get "libcabinet". If you want to create CAB files on UNIX
systems, get "Cablinux".

Get the official Microsoft CAB SDK from here:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/management/cab/cab-sdk.exe
You can use cabextract on this file to extract the contents.

Many thanks to Dirk Stoecker, Matthew Russoto and Dave Tritscher and,
of course, Microsoft for the documentation they _did_ provide wholly
and accurately. MSZIP is a one-byte adaption of the deflate and inflate
methods created by Phil Katz. Quantum is based on the Quantum archiver,
created by David Stafford. LZX is an adaption of the LZX method created
by Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen.

Furthermore, thanks to Jae Jung, for single-handedly fixing all the
bugs with LZX decompression in cabextract 0.1, and Eric Sharkey for the
original manual page.
