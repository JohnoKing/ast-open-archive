This directory contains the standalone code for ipv6 address longest
prefix match using an interval dictionary. The code is currently
AT&T PROPRIETARY, so don't propagate this outside of AT&T.

To build the test harness and run:

	make test

The library interface is implemented in libptv.a; include ptv.h in your
source and link your a.out with libptv.a. Makefile (used by old make) pulls
in standalone headers and source.

'testptv --man' lists the test harness man page on the standard error.
See testptv.c for example api usage -- ptv(3) documentation real soon now.
