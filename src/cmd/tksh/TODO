TODO

Need to do:
	1) CreatePipeline: parse >@ and <@ correctly
	2) Clean up includes
	3) Add a routetine to make channel from sfio_t
	   Create "sh_stdout"/"sh_stdin" OR "sfstdout"/"sfstdin" channels

Shell doesn't handle 1st level printing.  Alternative methods:
	1) Print only when funscope > 0
	2) Flag set when Tcl_Eval called, printing turned off at that point

Bindings:
	If a string is bound to an event, there is no way to tell if the
	string is a ksh command or a tcl command.  Solution here:  Assume
	tcl, if commands begins with "#!ksh\n" assume ksh.  Special bind
	prepends "#!ksh\n" if called from ksh interpreter.

	A solution might be to add a special call to convert a command
	string into a lang independent command string (eg preprend "#!ksh\n"
	or not); modify Tk to use it (one line change); possibly include mod.
	tk with tksh.

BUGS
--

1/16/97
	- makefile puts -lX11 at end of line, should be in middle
	- libshell-g.a doesn't handle socket right
	- Using sfstdin for tclIO.c doesn't work.  Exists after sfreserce fails
		main.c:375
	- Pipeline in tcl_eval doesn't work right
	- catch doesn't return right value for exec

	problem! printed in tclIO.c

	- On alpha, menus become buttons with widgets.ksh, Works for sun.
	   something to do with VAR=value functioncall

	- crash when getting variable with 512 flag inside sh_trap for init.

	- using b_cd() instead of Tcl_CdCmd causes deet to crash in the open
	  file dialog the first time.  "cd library-dir" acutally changes to
	  home directory for an unknown reason.  Works ok now with Tcl_CdCmd.

	- If $tk_library is a relative path, autoloading doesn't work.  Can
	  cause tksh to crash.

	Failing tests:
		cmdAH event(tkerror compatibility) exec env info(16.4, 16.5)
		interp(2.2)
