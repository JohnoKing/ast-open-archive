6/24/97	- (gsf@research.att.com) src/tclIO.c proto tweaks

4/10/97: Version 7.6 released
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4/9/97	- tcl_open |command works
	- Default interp mode is INTERP_TCL

3/9/97 	- Combined tksh.c interp.c to init.c	
	- Incorporated changes for Tcl 7.6
	- Inserted code to null terminate argv in InterpProc
	- waitevent sets interp type to tcl instead of having eval guess

9/4	- Reorganization of directory
	- Works with Tcl 7.5
	- Doesn't work with Tcl 7.4, Tcl 7.4 (requires Tk4.0)

	- Lots of new files, deleted files
2/29	- Tcl_RegExp*() changed to use posix regex
	- Tcl_RegExp*() cache change to avoid copying
	- Tcl_RegExpCompile arg 3 for case ignore match
	- drop stdarg.h from :: src list
	- drop malloc.h from tksh.h

2/25    - unset TK_LIBRARY in tk.ksh
	- modifications to Makefile, config.sh and config.tcl:
		make debug, make BASE=, removed debug option in interface
	- setsub now creates a null subscript
	- init.ksh sets argv0 & argv, uses discipline for env instead of trace
	- bug in Tksh_ConvertList fixed (didn't check errors properly)
	- Man page updated

2/21/96: Version 1.0b2 released
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2/21	- New version of Tksh paper
	- Man page updated
	- ksh version of source accepts standard input ; uses sfio

2/15	- Tcl_EvalFile works with Tcl mode
	- Result only printed if stdout is a string.

2/13	- Added sh_sigcheck to Tcl_TclEval, making it possible to stop an
	  infinite loop in a builtin.
	- Traces turned off in subshell

2/11	- Added array data field in array discipline, used for array searches.
	  TkshMakeArray now called TkshArrayData, separate nv_makearray macro.
	  Search ids allocated like tcl, using array data instead of hash table
	  set.test would pass, except ordering of elements is different (5 fail)
	  however, it meets specs.
	- Cleaned up tksh.h a bit
	- Added in .sh.result traced to interp->result
	- Added builtin setlist

2/8	- Added Tcl_UpVar, Tcl_UpVar2 functions
	- regexp.c used instead of shell patterns
	- fixed bug in proc test (but now file crashes)
	- changed behavior of "info commands" to strip off tcl_ so that
	  info.test passes

2/6	- rewrote portions of var.c - now the code is a lot easier to follow.
	  Set up to use the new NV_NODISC flag.  Two more trace tests pass.
	  Note - only one unset disc is called after a function clears scope.
	- Added pid command

2/4	- button.ksh invoke does not redirect stderr and stdout to /dev/null

2/3	- Moved TclOpen and TclRead from tk.c to tclunix.c
	- File reorganization:
		New file varcmd.c which has commands associated with vars
		 (taken from tclcommand.c)
		tclcommand.c renamed commands.c, command.c renamed eval.c
	  	commands.c has tclinfo.c and tclsource.c
	- Removed tcllist.c, tclstring.c and tclresult.c and put tclUtil.c
	  into tcl directory (only a couple of changes necessary to tclUtil.c)
	- Tcl_SetErrorCode.c remvoed from tclerr.c (in tclUtil.c)
	- Makefile updated accordingly
	- Fixed bug with bind : #! in bindscript was ignored

2/2	- Fixed up/down arrow key problem in tk library

2/1	- Removed printing of "after" for entry widgets
	- Removed return in Tcl_UntraceVar (return void doesn't work for sgi)

1/30	- Added in checks to config.sh for -lsocket and -lnsl
	- added fixstrtod (used in libtk.a on Solaris)
	- moved "widget" to scripts directory and made symbolic link to it
	- created "tksh" directory for binaries

1/29	- Changed name of directory "kshmain" to "obsolete"
	- Fixed ifdef 0 in tk.c
	- tclinfo.c and interp.c use function TkshLibDir(), defined in tksh.c
	- tksh_builtin_command sets sh.exitval to 1 on error
