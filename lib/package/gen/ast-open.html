<STRONG>3d</STRONG>
is the historical name for
<EM>n</EM><STRONG>DFS</STRONG><EM>,</EM>
the multiple dimension file system.
It is implemented as a shared library that is preloaded
before any other shared library using the recently documented
(<EM>ahem</EM>)
<STRONG>LD_PRELOAD</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>_RLD_LIST</STRONG>
feature of the runtime linker.
<STRONG>3d</STRONG>
intercepts pathname system calls (and other calls if tracing is
turned on) and provides a logical namespace on top of the underlying
physical file system.
The shared library implementation currently works
only on
<EM>bsd.i386</EM>,
<EM>linux.i386</EM>,
<EM>osf.alpha</EM>,
<EM>sun4</EM>,
<EM>sol.*</EM>,
and
<EM>sgi.*</EM>.
<P>
<STRONG>3d</STRONG>
works in conjunction with
<STRONG>ksh88</STRONG>
or
<STRONG>ksh93</STRONG>.
The
<STRONG>3d</STRONG>
command with no arguments enters a
<STRONG>3d</STRONG>
shell.
The
<STRONG>vpath</STRONG>
builtin controls the logical
filesystem view:
<PRE>
     vpath dir_1 dir_2
</PRE>
mounts the directory hierarchy
<EM>dir_1</EM>
on top of
<EM>dir_2</EM>.
Files under
<EM>dir_1</EM>
overlay files under
<EM>dir_2</EM>.
Files under
<EM>dir_2</EM>
are readonly;
any files under
<EM>dir_2</EM>
that are modified are first copied to the
corresponding place in
<EM>dir_1</EM>.
<EM>vpaths</EM>
may be chained:
<PRE>
     vpath dir_2 dir_3
</PRE>
<EM>vpaths</EM>
are per-process; every process may have a different view.
<EM>vpaths</EM>
are a handy way to separate source and generated files.
Typical
<STRONG>advsoft</STRONG>
users set up
<STRONG>3d</STRONG>
at login or
<STRONG>xterm</STRONG>
time:
<PRE>
     export HOSTTYPE=$(package)
     vpath $HOME/arch/$HOSTTYPE $HOME
</PRE>
with source files in
<TT>$HOME/src/(cmd|lib)/*</TT>.
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>
is run in
<TT>$HOME/arch/$HOSTTYPE/src/(cmd|lib)/*</TT>
and generated files (objects and executables) are dropped in the top hierarchy.
<P>
<STRONG>2d</STRONG>
can prefix any command to disable 
<STRONG>3d</STRONG>
for that command:
<PRE>
     2d ls *.c
</PRE>
<P>
<STRONG>3d</STRONG>
also provides tracing, monitoring and call intercept services.
<STRONG>vpm</STRONG>
uses monitoring to graph the process and io hierarchy.
The
<EM>cs</EM>
name server uses pathname call intercepts to translate network
pathnames.
Try this for any host:
<PRE>
     cat /dev/tcp/hostname/inet.daytime
</PRE>

because the \bat\b service executor \b$INSTALLROOT/lib/at/jobs/atx\b must be
installed setuid \broot\b so the daemon can operate multi-user

<STRONG>coshell</STRONG>
executes blocks of shell commands on lightly loaded hosts in the local network.
There is one
<STRONG>coshell</STRONG>
server per user.
This server runs as a daemon on the user's home host,
and only processes running on the home host have access to the server.
The server controls a background
<STRONG>ksh</STRONG>
shell process, initiated by
<STRONG>rsh</STRONG>,
on each of the connected hosts.
<P>
<STRONG>coshell</STRONG>
is easy to use and administer.
The only privilege required for installation, administration or use is
<STRONG>rsh</STRONG>
access to the local hosts.
<STRONG>coshell</STRONG>
does requires a uniform file namespace across all hosts on the local network.
<P>
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>gmake</STRONG>
users can take advantage of network execution with
no makefile modifications.
Shell level access is similar to but more efficient than
<STRONG>rsh</STRONG>
and allows host expression matching to replace the explicit host name argument.
<P>
Factor of 5 compilation speedups are typical.

To start your local daemon:
<PRE>
     coshell +
</PRE>
To send
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>

actions to
<STRONG>coshell</STRONG>
at concurrency level 8:
<PRE>
     export COSHELL=coshell
     export NPROC=8
</PRE>
To run shell commands on a lightly loaded host:
<PRE>
     coshell -r - 'hostname; sort a &gt; b' &amp;
     pid=$!
     # other stuff
     wait $pid
</PRE>
For interactive

input line edit discipline pushed on the standard input.
All child processes will also have input line editing enabled.

KSH-93 is the most recent version of the KornShell Language
described in
"The KornShell Command and Programming Language,"
by Morris Bolsky and David Korn of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, ISBN 0-13-182700-6.
The KornShell is a shell programming language,
which is upward compatible with "sh" (the Bourne Shell),
and is intended to conform to the IEEE P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and
Utilities standard.
KSH-93 provides an enhanced programming environment in
addition to the major command-entry features of the BSD
shell "csh".  With KSH-93, medium-sized programming tasks can be
performed at shell-level without a significant loss in performance.
In addition, "sh" scripts can be run on KSH-93 without modification.
<P>
The code should conform to the IEEE POSIX 1003.1 standard and to the
proposed ANSI-C standard so that it should be portable to all
such systems.  Like the previous version, KSH-88,
it is designed to accept eight bit character sets
transparently, thereby making it internationally compatible.
It can support multi-byte characters sets with some characteristics
of the character set given at run time.
<P>
KSH-93 provides the following features, many of which were also inherent
in KSH-88:
<UL type=square>
<LI>
Enhanced Command Re-entry Capability:  The KSH-93 history
function records commands entered at any shell level and stores
them, up to a user-specified limit, even after you log off.
This allows you to re-enter long commands with a few keystrokes
- even those commands you entered yesterday.
The history file allows for eight bit characters in
commands and supports essentially unlimited size histories.
<LI>
In-line Editing: In "sh", the only way to fix mistyped
commands is to backspace or retype the line. KSH-93 allows you
to edit a command line using a choice of EMACS-TC or "vi"
functions.
You can use the in-line editors to complete filenames as
you type them.
You may also use this editing feature when entering
command lines from your history file.
A user can capture keystrokes and rebind keys to customize the
editing interface.
<LI>
Extended I/O Capabilities:  KSH-93 provides several I/O
capabilities not available in "sh", including the ability to:
<UL type=circle>
<LI>
specify a file descriptor for input and output
<LI>
start up and run co-processes
<LI>
produce a prompt at the terminal before a read
<LI>
easily format and interpret responses to a menu
<LI>
echo lines exactly as output without escape processing
<LI>
format output using printf formats.
<LI>
read and echo lines ending in "&#0092;".
</UL>
<LI>
Improved performance: KSH-93 executes many scripts faster
than the System V Bourne shell. A major reason for this is
that many of the standard utilities are built-in.
To reduce the time to initiate a command, KSH-93 allows
commands to be added as built-ins at run time
on systems that support dynamic loading such as System V Release 4.
<LI>
Arithmetic: KSH-93 allows you to do integer arithmetic in any
base from two to sixty-four.  You can also do double
precision floating point arithmetic.
Almost the complete set of C language operators are available
with the same syntax and precedence.
Arithmetic expressions can be used to as an argument expansion 
or as a separate command.
In addition there is an arithmetic for command that works
like the for statement in C.
<LI>
Arrays: KSH-93 supports both indexed and associative arrays.
The subscript for an indexed array is an arithmetic expression,
whereas, the subscript for an associative array is a string.
<LI>
Shell Functions and Aliases: Two mechanisms - functions and
aliases - can be used to assign a user-selected identifier to
an existing command or shell script.
Functions allow local variables and provide scoping
for exception handling.
Functions can be searched for and loaded on first reference the
way scripts are.
<LI>
Substring Capabilities:  KSH-93 allows you to create a
substring of any given string either by specifying the starting
offset and length, or by stripping off leading
or trailing substrings during parameter substitution.
You can also specify attributes, such as upper and lower case,
field width, and justification to shell variables.
<LI>
More pattern matching capabilities:  KSH-93 allows you to specify
extended regular expressions for file and string matches.
<LI>
KSH-93 uses a hierarchal name space for variables.
Compound variables can be defined and variables can
be passed by reference.  In addition, each variable
can have one or more disciplines associated with
it to intercept assignments and references.
<LI>
Improved debugging:  KSH-93 can generate line numbers on execution
traces.  Also, I/O redirections are now traced.
There is a DEBUG trap that gets evaluated after each command
so that errors can be localized.
<LI>
Job Control: On systems that support job control, including
System V Release 4, KSH-93
provides a job-control mechanism almost identical to that of
the BSD "csh", version 4.1.
This feature allows you
to stop and restart programs, and to move programs between the
foreground and the background.
<LI>
Added security:
KSH-93 can execute scripts which do not have read permission
and scripts which have the setuid and/or setgid set when
invoked by name, rather than as an argument to the shell.
It is possible to log or control the execution of setuid and/or
setgid scripts.
The noclobber option prevents you from accidentally erasing
a file by redirecting to an existing file.
<LI>
KSH-93 can be extended by adding built-in commands at run time.
In addition, KSH-93 can be used as a library that can
be embedded into an application to allow scripting.
</UL>
Documentation for KSH-93 consists of an "Introduction to KSH-93",
"Compatibility with the Bourne Shell" and a manual page and a
README file.  In addition, the "New KornShell Command and Programming
Language," book is available from Prentice Hall.

<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>
is the AT&amp;T
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>,
first released in 1985.
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>
is a modern variant of the traditional Feldman
<STRONG>make</STRONG>
with an important difference:
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>
maintains state that records
information for future runs.
The state includes:
<UL type=square>
<LI>
file modification times
<LI>
explicit prerequisites (from makefile assertions)
<LI>
implicit prerequisites (from
<EM>#include</EM>
scanning)
<LI>
action text (used to build targets)
<LI>
variable values
<LI>
target attributes
</UL>
State
<EM>and</EM>
a language to manipulate it finally makes concise
makefiles a reality; concise because rules traditionally placed in
each makefile can now be implemented in a general way in a single
<EM>base rules</EM>
file.
The base rules are such a fundamental part of
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>
that most of its visible features are controlled by them.
<P>
Most makefiles are just a few lines:
<PRE>
     :PACKAGE: X11
     
     xgame :: README xgame.6 xgame.h xgame.c xutil.c -lXaw -lXmu -lXt
</PRE>
Automatically generated
<STRONG>probe</STRONG>
information provides convenient compiler abstractions:
<PRE>
     CCFLAGS = $(CC.DLL)
     
     ast 4.0 :LIBRARY: ast.c strmatch.c
</PRE>
In this case if the compiler supports
shared libraries (aka <STRONG>dll</STRONG><EM>s</EM>) then
<TT>nmake install</TT>
will generate
<EM>libast.a</EM>
and
<EM>libast.so.4.0</EM>
(or the appropriate shared library suffix determined by
<STRONG>CC.SUFFIX.SHARED</STRONG>).
There are no
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>
makefile generators (because the makefiles are so small),
there is no separate
<TT>make depend</TT>
(because the files with
<EM>.SCAN</EM>
attributes are automatically scanned for implicit prerequisites),
and there is no cheating (because all time stamp changes
are detected, not just
<EM>newer-than</EM>).

<STRONG>proto</STRONG>
converts ANSI C prototype constructs to constructs compatible
with K&amp;R C, ANSI C, and C++.
Only files with the line
<PRE>
     #pragma prototyped

in the first 64 lines are processed; other files are silently ignored.
This is how
<STRONG>advsoft</STRONG>
source is first shipped to foreign architectures.
Once
<STRONG>advsoft</STRONG>
is bootstrapped the
non-<STRONG>proto</STRONG>
source can be built using the
<STRONG>advsoft</STRONG>
tools.
<P>
<STRONG>proto</STRONG>
also converts in the other direction by providing
<EM>extern</EM>
prototypes for a collection of K&amp;R source files and by converting
K&amp;R source files in place.
K&amp;R to ANSI is not 100%, but is a good starting point for manual conversion.
<P>
<STRONG>proto</STRONG>
is token based (no C grammar); this allows it to convert 
before C preprocessing, and also allows
<STRONG>proto</STRONG>
to be inserted into
the standalone
<STRONG>cpp</STRONG>.
This is how
<STRONG>nmake</STRONG>
compiles ANSI C source with K&amp;R compilers.

Fixed length record data is often viewed as a waste of space,
too sparse for production use.
Much effort is then put into optimizing
the data schema, and in the process complicating the data interface.
<STRONG>pzip</STRONG>
shows that in many cases this view of fixed length data is wrong.
In fact, variable length data may become more compressible when
converted to a sparse, fixed length format.
Intense semantic schema
analysis can be replaced by an automated record partition, resulting in
compression space improvements of 2 to 10 times and decompression speed
improvements of 2 to 3 times over
<STRONG>gzip</STRONG>
for a large class of data.

<EM>tksh</EM>
is an implementation of the Tcl C library
written on top of the library for the new KornShell
(<EM>ksh93</EM>).
<EM>tksh</EM>
emulates the behavior of Tcl by using the API that is provided for extending
<EM>ksh93</EM>,
which is similar to the Tcl library in that it allows access to
variables, functions and other state of the interpreter.
This implementation requires no modification to
<EM>ksh93</EM>,
and allows Tcl libraries such as Tk to run on top of
<EM>ksh93</EM>
unchanged,
making it possible to use shell scripts in
place of Tcl scripts. 
<EM>ksh93</EM>
is well suited for use with Tk because it is
backward compatible with
<EM>sh</EM>,
making it both easy to learn and easy to extend
existing scripts to provide a graphical user interface.
<P>
<EM>tksh</EM>
is not yet
another port of Tk to another language -- it allows Tcl scripts to run without
modification using the ksh93 internals.
This makes it possible to combine
Tcl and
<EM>ksh93</EM>,
which is useful for writing
<EM>ksh93</EM>
scripts that use components that have been implemented in Tcl
(such as Tk widgets).

<STRONG>warp</STRONG>
executes a dynamically linked command in a different time frame.
It intercepts time related system calls and modifies the times seen by
the command using the formula:
<PRE>
     time' = time + warp + (time - base) * (factor - 1)
</PRE>
where:
<UL type=square>
<LI>
<EM>time'</EM>
The logical system time seen by the command process.
<LI>
<EM>time</EM>
The physical system time.
<LI>
<EM>warp</EM>
A fixed offset from the physical system time
(i.e., the warp.)
<LI>
<EM>base</EM>
The physical system time when
<STRONG>warp</STRONG>
was first applied to the process or any ancestor process.
<LI>
<EM>factor</EM>
The rate of logical time change with respect to the physical clock
(i.e., the warp factor.)
</UL>
<EM>warp</EM>,
<EM>base</EM>,
and
<EM>factor</EM>
are inherited by children of warped processes so that a child process
is warped in the same time frame as its parent.
Time progresses for warped processes at the rate of
<EM>factor</EM>
times the physical system clock.
Any files created by a warped process
will appear to be in the warped logical time frame
for that process but will appear in physical system time frame
for non-warped processes.
<P>
Statically-linked, set-uid or set-gid commands are not warped.

03-07-20  --- Release ksh93o+  ---
03-07-20  A bug in which could cause memory corruption when a posix
	  function invoked another one has been fixed.
03-07-15  A bug in which a file descriptor&gt;2 could be closed before
	  executing a script has been fixed.
03-07-15  A parsing error for &lt;() and &gt;() process subsitituions inside
	  command substitution has been fixed.
03-07-15  A parsing error for patterns of the form {...}(...) when
	  used inside ${...} has been fixed.
03-07-15  An error in which expanding an indexed array inside a compound
	  variable could cause a core dump has been fixed.
03-07-15  A bug in which under on rare ocassions a job completion interrupt
	  could cause to core dump has been fixed.
03-06-26  A bug in which process substitution embeded within command
	  substitution would generate a syntax error has been fixed.
03-96-23  A bug in which ${@:offset:len} could core dump when there
	  were no arguments has been fixed.
03-96-23  A bug in which ${X&#0091;@&#0093;:offset:len} could core dump when X
	  was unset has been fixed.
03-06-22  The -x option was added to the command builtin.  If this
	  option is on, and the number of arguments would exceed ARG_MAX,
	  the command will be invoked multiple times with a subset of
	  the arguments.  For example, with alias grep='command -x grep,
	  any number of arguments can be specified.
03-06-14  A bug in which could cause a core dump on some systems with
	  vi and emacs editors with the MULTIBYTE option has been fixed.
03-06-06  A bug in which the shell could core dump when a script was
	  run from its directory, and the script name a symlink to a file
	  beginning with .., has been fixed.
03-06-05  A bug in which the shell could core dump when a child process
	  that it is unaware of terminates while it is calling malloc()
	  has been fixed.
03-06-02  An option named globstar (set -G) has been added.  When enabled,
	  during pathname expansion, any component that consists only of ** is
	  matches all files and any number of directory levels.
03-05-30  A bug in which the PATH search could give incorrect results when
	  run from directory foo and PATH contained .:foo:xxx has been fixed.
03-05-29  Some changes were made to the code that displays the prompt in edit 
	  mode to better handle escape sequences in the prompt.
03-05-27  I added = to the list of characters that mark the beginning of
	  a word for edit completion so that filenames in assignments
	  can be completed.
03-05-20  A bug in which read -N could hang on some systems when reading
	  from a terminal or a pipe has been fixed.
03-05-19  A bug in which the ouput of uname from a command substitution
	  would go to the standard output of the invoking command when
	  uname was invoked with a non-standard option has been fixed.
03-05-19  A job control bug which would cause the shell to exit because 
	  it hadn't take back the terminal has been fixed.  The bug
	  could occur when running a function that contained a pipeline
	  whose last element was a function.
03-05-19  A job control timing bug introduced in ksh93o on some systems
	  which could cause a pipeline to hang if the first component
	  completed quickly has been fixed.
03-05-13  The read builtin has been modified so that the builtin editors
	  will not overwrite output from a previous incomplete line. 
03-05-13  A bug in which the name of an identifier could have the string
	  .sh. prefixed to it after expanding a variable whose name begins
	  with .sh. has been fixed.
03-05-13  A bug in the expansion of $var for compound variables in which
	  some elements would not be output when the name was a prefix
	  of another name in the compound variable has been fixed.
03-05-08  The last item in the ksh93o release on 03-01-02 has been
	  altered sligthly to preserve the leading 0's when the
	  preceding character is a digit.  Thus, with typeset -LZ3 x=10,
	  $(( 1$x)) will be 1010 whereas $(( $x) will be 10.
03-04-25  A bug in which if x is a name reference, then nameref y=x.foo
	  did not follow x has been fixed.

03-03-18  --- Release ksh93o  ---
03-03-18  A -N unary operator was added to test and &#0091;&#0091;...&#0093;&#0093; which returns
	  true if the file exists and the file has been modified since it
	  was last read.
03-03-18  The TIMEFORMAT variable was added to control the format for
	  the time compound command.  The formatting description is
	  described in the man page.
03-03-06  A -N n option was added to read which causes exactly n bytes
	  to be read unlike -n n which causes at most n bytes to be read.
03-03-03  Three new shell variables were added.  The variable .sh.file
	  stores the full pathname of the file that the current command
	  was found in.  The variable .sh.fun names the current function
	  that is running.  The variable .sh.subshell contains the depth
	  of the current subshell or command substitution.
03-03-03  When the DEBUG trap is executed, the current command line after
	  expansions is placed in the variable .sh.command.  The trap
	  is also now triggered before each iteration of a for, select,
	  and case command and before each assignment and redirection.
03-02-28  Function definitions are no longer stored in the history file so
	  that set -o nolog no longer has any meaning.
03-02-28  All function definitions can be displayed with typeset -f not
	  just those stored in the history file.  In addition, typeset +f
	  displays the function name followed by a comment containg the
	  line number and the path name for the file that defined this function.
03-02-28  A bug in which the value of $LINENO was not correct when executing
	  command contained inside mult-line command substitutions has been
	  fixed.
03-02-19  Since some existing ksh88 scripts use the undocumented and
	  unintended ability to insert a : in front of the % and # parameter
	  expansion operators, ksh93 was modified to accept :% as equivalent
	  to % and :# as equivalent to # with ${name op word}.
03-02-14  A bug which could cause a core dump when reading from standard
	  error when standard error was a pty has been fixed.
03-02-14  The shell arithmetic was modified to use long double on systems
	  that provide this data type.
03-02-09  A bug in which a function located in the first directory in FPATH
	  would not be found when the last component of PATH was . and the
	  current directory was one of the directories in PATH has been fixed.
03-02-07  The trap and kill builtin commands now accept a leading SIG prefix
	  on the signal names as documented.
03-02-05  A bug in the expansion of ${var/$pattern}, when pattern contained
	  \&#0091; has been fixed.
03-02-05  A bug in which .sh.match&#0091;n&#0093;, n&gt;0, was not being set for substring
	  matches with % and %% has been fixed.
03-01-15  A bug in which getopts did not work for numerical arguments specified
	  as n#var in the getopts string has been fixed.
03-01-09  A bug in which using ${.sh.match} multiple times could lead to
	  a memory exception has been fixed.
03-01-06  A bug in the expansion of ${var/pattern/$string} in the case that
	  $string contains \digit has been fixed. 
03-01-02  A -P option was added for systems such as Solaris 8 that support
	  profile shell.
03-01-02  For backward compatibility with ksh88, arithmetic expansion
	  with ((...)) and let has been modified so that if x is a zero-filled
	  variable, $x will not be treated as an octal constant.

02-12-05  --- Release ksh93n+  ---
02-11-30  A bug that can show up in evaluating arithmetic statements that
	  are in an autoloaded function when the function is autoload from
	  another function has been fixed.
02-11-30  An optimization bug in which an expansion of the form ${!name.@},
	  which occurred inside a for or a while loop, when name is a name
	  reference, has been fixed.
02-11-18  A bug in which modifying array variables in a subshell could leave
	  side effects in the parent shell environment has been fixed.
02-11-18  A memory leak when unsetting an associative array has been fixed.
02-11-14  The code to display compound objects was rewritten to make
	  it easier for runtime extensions to reuse this code.
02-11-14  A change was made to allow runtime builtins to be notified when
	  a signal is received so that cleanup can be performed.
02-10-31  User applications can now trap the ALRM signal.  Previously,
	  the ALRM signal was used internally and could not be used
	  by applications. 
02-10-31  A bug in which signals received while reading from a coprocess
	  for which traps were set was not handled correctly has been fixed.
02-10-31  A bug in which a file opened with exec inside a subshell could
	  be closed before the subshell completed has been fixed.
02-10-21  A bug in which setting PATH or FPATH inside a function might not
	  take effect has been fixed.
02-10-21  A bug which could cause a core dump when a local SECONDS variable
	  is defined in a function has been fixed.
02-10-15  A bug in which the associate array name operator ${!array&#0091;@&#0093;}
	  could return the same name multiple times has been fixed.
02-10-15  A bug in which the zero'th element of an associative array was
	  not getting set when an assignment was made without a subscript
	  specified has been fixed.

02-09-30  --- Release ksh93n  ---
02-09-30  The maximum indexed array size was increased to 16Megs.
02-09-30  A bug which could cause a core dump when changing attributes
	  of associative array has been fixed.
02-09-30  A bug in which exporting an array variable would not export the
	  0-th element has been fixed.
02-09-30  A bug in which an array assignment of the form a=($a ...) would unset
	  'a' before the right hand side was evaluated has been fixed.
02-09-27  A bug in which the error message for ${var?message} when var was
	  null or unset did not contain the variable name var has been fixed.
02-09-27  A bug in which closing file descriptors 0 through 2 could
	  cause a subsequent here document to fail has been fixed. 
02-09-14  A bug in whence which occurs when the specified name contained
	  a / has been fixed.
02-09-14  A bug in the parser for strings of the form name$((expr))=value
	  has been fixed.
02-09-14  A for loop optimization bug in which the number of elements in
	  an array was treated as an invariant has been fixed.
02-09-09  A bug in which redirection or closing of a file descriptor between
	  3 and 9 could cause a subsequent here document to fail has been
	  fixed. 
02-09-09  A bug in which a background job was not removed from the job list
	  when a subshell completed has been fixed, for example (prog&amp;). 
02-09-03  A bug in which an assignment of the form name=(integer x=3)
	  could be interpretted as an array assignment rather than a
	  compound variable assignment has been fixed.
02-08-19  A command completion bug which occurred on file systems that
	  are case insensitive has been fixed.
02-08-19  A bug which could lead to an exception on some systems (for
	  example FREEBSD) which occurred when setting PATH has been fixed.
02-08-11  A bug in arithmetic rounding in which a value input as a decimal
	  string would output as a rounded version of the string has
	  been fixed.
02-08-11  A bug in which the last character could be deleted from shell
	  traces and from whence when called from a multibyte locale
	  has been fixed.
02-08-01  A bug which could cause a core dump to occur when a shell script
	  is executed while a coprocess is running that has closed the
	  output pipe has been fixed.
02-08-01  A bug in which command completion in multibyte mode could
	  corrupt memory for long command lines has been fixed.

02-06-17  --- Release ksh93n-  ---
02-06-17  A bug in which user defined macros could cause a core dump in
	  with MULTIBYE mode has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which printf format specifiers of the form %2$s were causing
	  a core dump has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which setting stty to noecho mode did not prevent the
	  echoing of characters by ksh when emacs or viraw mode
	  was enabled has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which background job completion could cause the sleep
	  builtin to terminate prematurely has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which the shell could core dump if getopts was called
	  when the OPTIND variable contained a negative value has been fixed. 
02-06-10  The edit mode prompt has been modified to handle escape sequences.  
02-06-10  A bug which occurred for interactive shells in which the builtin
	  cat command was used in command substitution on a file whose
	  size was larger than PIPE_BUF has been fixed.
02-06-10  A bug in which the trap on ERR was not being processed when
	  set inside a function has been fixed.
02-06-07  A bug in which function definitions could cause the history count
	  to be decremented by one (and even become negative) has been fixed.
02-06-05  A bug in read in which share mode could be enabled has been fixed.
02-05-28  A bug which could occur when the last command of a script was
	  a case statement and the action selected ended in ;&amp; instead of ;;
	  has been fixed.
02-05-23  A bug with unary + introduced in ksh93k has been fixed.
02-05-07  A bug in substitutions of the form ${var/pattern/string} in which
	  a backslash was inserted in the replacement string when it contained
	  a special pattern character has been fixed.
02-05-01  A bug in the emacs edit mode which occurred in versions compiled
	  for multibyte character sets which occurred when a repeated search
	  was requested after a long line had been returned for the previous
	  search has been fixed.
02-04-02  vi and emacs edit modes were modified so that tab completion is
	  disabled when invoked from the read built-in.

02-03-26  --- Release ksh93m+  ---
02-03-26  A bug in which &nbsp;was not handled correctly when used in file
	  expansion has been fixed.
02-02-18  A bug in which lines beginning with a # were deleted from here
	  documents when the here-document delimiter was followed by
	  a comment has been fixed.
02-12-06  An optimization bug in which ${!x&#0091;@&#0093;) was treated as invariant in
	  a for loop has been fixed.
02-02-06  A bug in which the ERR trap is not cleared for a script invoked
	  by name from within a function has been fixed.
02-01-08  A bug in which a shell script executed from within a subshell
	  could cause this script to have an invalid pointer leading
	  to a memory fault has been fixed. 
02-01-07  Added here documents of the form &lt;&lt;&lt; word (as per zsh) which
	  is equivalent to &lt;&lt; delimordelim.
02-01-07  A bug in which the first word of a compound assignment,
	  x=(word ...), was treated as a reserved word has been fixed.
02-01-07  A bug in the handling of &nbsp;when noglob was enabled and a
	  substitution of the form ${word op pattern} occurred in the
	  same word has been fixed.
02-01-07  A compilation option, CMDLIB_BLTIN in the file OPTION, has
	  been added.  When this options is set, all commands implemented
	  in libcmd become shell builtin commands by default.
02-01-07  A bug in which builtin foo, where foo is already a builtin
	  would result in the builtin foo getting removed has been fixed. 
02-01-07  A bug which the shell executed a command found in the current
	  directory when PATH have no valid directories has been fixed.
01-11-28  The value of $? was not being set when called with exit.
01-11-28  If the last command was of the form (...) and a trap on EXIT or
	  ERR was set, and the command inside () modified the trap, then
	  the original trap wasn't executed.
01-11-26  The value for 0 is now preceded by the base number when
	  the base was not 10.
01-11-26  The default has compilation mode has been changes so that
	  viraw mode will always be on.

01-10-31  --- Release ksh93m  ---
01-10-31  A for loop optimizer bug for subshells contained withing for
	  loops has been fixed.
01-10-16  typeset without arguments no longer outputs variable names
	  that do not have any attributes that are set.
01-10-16  A bug introduced in ksh93l in which assignments specified with
	  the exec built-in were not being expanded properly has been
	  fixed.
01-10-11  An optimization bug in which ${!x) was treated as invariant in
	  a for loop has been fixed.
01-10-11  Unsigned integer variables in bases other than 10 are printed now
	  expand in that base with the base prefix.
01-10-10  A number of typos in the self generating man pages for shell
	  built-ins have been fixed.
01-10-04  The self generated man pages for hist and fc were not working
	  correctly and have been fixed.
01-10-03  Yet another optimizer bug in which shell patterns were
	  treated as invariants has been fixed.
01-09-27  Two bugs relating to multibyte history searches and to find
	  have been fixed.
01-09-27  A bug introduced in ksh93k in which the PATH searching was
	  not restored after running a command with an assignment list 
	  has been fixed.
01-09-26  A bug in which a zero filled field was treated as octal when
	  converted to integer has been fixed.
01-09-26  Yet another bug in the optimization of for loops related to
	  recursive functions with break or continue statements has been fixed.
01-09-25  The exponentiation operator ** was added to the shell arithmetic
	  evaluation.  It has higher precedence than * and is left
	  associative.
01-09-25  The code was modified to use the ast multibyte macros
	  and functions for handing multibyte locales.
01-09-25  The expansion ${parameter:offset:length} now handles negative
	  offsets which cause offsets to be measured from the end.
01-09-25  Some spelling errors in the documentation were corrected.
01-09-24  The /dev/tcp/host/port and /dev/udp/host/port now allow
	  the ports to be specified by service name. 
01-09-24  The change staring with ksh93g in which the the appropriate
	  library path variable is prepended with a corresponding library
	  directory has been modified.  With the new method, only the
	  library path defined in the file named .paths in the directory
	  where the executable is found will be modified.  See the
	  man page for more details.
01-09-23  The .fpath file (see ksh93h) is no longer looked for in each
	  directory on the path to locate function directories.  The
	  file named .paths is used instead.
01-09-23  A bug in which IFS was not being restored after being changed in
	  a subshell has been fixed.
01-09-16  With the vi and emacs edit modes, after a list of command
	  or functions is generated with = or M-= respectively,
	  any element from the list can be pasted on the command line
	  by preceding the = or M-= with a numeric parameter specifying
	  the position on the list.
01-09-16  A bug in ksh93l caused command completion not to find aliases
	  and functions.  Command listing from the edit mode was presented
	  in reverse order.  This has been fixed.
01-09-13  Another bug in the optimization of for loops related to subshells
	  when traps were set has been fixed.
01-09-07  A change in ksh93l caused brace expansion to stop working
	  and this has been fixed.
01-09-04  A bug introduced in ksh93k in which an arithmetic statement
	  within a function that used name references did not follow the
	  reference has been fixed.
01-09-04  A bug introduced in ksh93l in which export -p did not prefix
	  each export with the word export has been fixed.
01-08-29  A bug in multibyte input which occurred when a partial multibyte
	  character was received has been fixed.
01-08-29  A bug introduced in ksh93l which could cause a core dump
	  when an assignment list containing PATH is specified inside
	  command substitution has been fixed.
01-08-09  Another bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  errors in recursive functions using local variables that
	  contained for loops has been fixed.
01-07-27  A bug in which IFS would be unset after a command substitution
	  inside a here document has been fixed.
01-07-26  To conform to the POSIX standard, if you invoked ksh name,
	  and name does not contain a /,  it will first try to run
	  one in the current directory whether it is executable or not
	  before doing a path search for an executable script.  Earlier
	  versions first checked for an executable script using the
	  PATH variable.
01-07-23  A bug in which unset -f invoked in a subshell could unset a
	  function defined in the parent has been fixed.
01-07-16  A bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  name references to be treated as invariants has been fixed.
01-07-09  A bug in which a discipline function applied to a local variable
	  could cause a shell exception has been fixed.  Discipline
	  functions can only be specified for global variables. 

01-06-18  --- Release ksh93l  ---
01-06-18  A bug in assigning integers larger than can be represented as
	  long integers to floating point variables has been fixed.
01-06-18  A bug in the handling of unsigned integers (typeset -ui) has
	  been fixed.
01-06-04  The evaluation of the PS1 prompt no longer effects the value
	  of the $? variable.
01-06-01  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-22  A bug in which attributes for variables that did not have
	  values would be lost after a subshell has been fixed.
01-05-22  The %R format has been added to convert a shell pattern into
	  an extended regular expression.
01-05-22  The escape sequences &#0092;, <JOIN>X, \C&#0091;.collating-element.&#0093;, and
	  \x{hex} have been added to ASCII-C strings and to printf format
	  strings.
01-05-20  Patterns of the form {n}(pattern) and {m,n}(pattern) are now
	  recognized.  The first form matches exactly n of pattern whereas,
	  the second form matches from m to n instances of pattern.
01-05-20  The shell allows *-(pattern), +-(pattern),  ?-(pattern),
	  {m,n}-(pattern}, and @-(pattern) to cause the minimal
	  match of pattern to be selected whenever possible rather
	  than the maximal (greedy) match. 
01-05-20  The character class &#0091;:word:&#0093; has been added to patterns.
	  The word class is the union of &#0091;:alnum:&#0093; and the character _.
01-05-20  Inside (...) pattern groups, the &nbsp;character is now treated
	  specially even when in an enclosing character class.  The
	  sequences, \w, \d, \s are equivalent to the character classes
	  word, digit, and space respectively.  The sequences \W, \D,
	  and \S are their complement sets. 
01-05-20  The shell now recognizes pattern groups of the form
	  ~(options:pattern) where options or :pattern can be omitted.
	  Options use the letters + and - to enable and disable options
	  respectively.  The option letters g (greedy), i (ignore case)
	  are used to cause maximal matching and to cause case
	  insensitive matching respectively.  If :pattern is also
	  specified, these options are only in effect while this
	  pattern is being processed.  Otherwise, these options remain
	  in effect until the end of the pattern group that they are contained
	  in or until another ~(...) is encountered.  These pattern groups
	  are not counted with respect to group numbering.
01-05-14  When edit completion, expansion, or listing occurs in the
	  middle of a quoted string, the leading quote is ignored when
	  performing the completion, expansion, or listing.
01-05-14  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-10  A bug in which open files were not restored after a subshell
	  that had used exec to replace a file has been fixed. 
01-05-10  Redirection to a null file name now generates an error message. 
01-05-09  The shell now rejects some invalid parameter substitutions that
	  were previously processed in undefined ways.
01-05-09  A bug in which the output of select was not flushed before the
	  read when input did not come from the terminal has been fixed. 
01-05-08  A bug in which job ids would not be freed for interactive shells
	  when subshells ran built-ins in the background has been fixed.
01-05-08  The FPATH variable now requires an explicit . to cause the
	  current directory to be treated as a function directory. 
01-05-08  A bug in read -n when echo mode was disabled has been fixed.
01-05-07  A bug in which function definitions could be listed as part
	  of the history has been fixed.
01-04-30  This release uses a new and often much faster pattern matcher than
	  earlier releases.
01-04-30  An optimizer now eliminates invariant parameter expansions from
	  for while and until loops.
01-04-30  The variable .sh.match is set after each pattern match (# % or /)
	  in a variable substitution.  The variable .sh.match is an
	  indexed array with element 0 being the complete match. 
	  The array is only valid until the next subsequent pattern
	  match or until the value of the variable changes which ever
	  comes first.
01-04-30  A self generating man page has been added to shcomp.  Also,
	  shcomp now stops compiling when it finds an exit or exec
	  command and copies the remainder so that it can be used
	  for standard input.
01-04-30  The shcomp command was modified so that it can work in an
	  EBCIDIC environment and that binary scripts are portable
	  across environments.
01-04-30  A bug in the handling of a trailing : in PATH has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which the builtin version of a command would get invoked
	  even though the full pathname for the command was specified
	  has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which read would loose the last character when
	  reading the last line of a file that did not contain a new-line
	  character has been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which in vi mode the end of file
	  character and end of line character could be swapped has
	  been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which invoking a shell script that
	  did not have execute permission could set the exit value to
	  127 rather than 126 has been fixed.
01-04-20  A bug in which read -n from a pipe would block if fewer than
	  n characters was received has been fixed.
01-04-09  A bug in which invalid patterns, for example, ) by itself,
	  was not treated as a string has been fixed so that if i=')',
	  then &#0091;&#0091; $i == $i &#0093;&#0093; is true.
01-04-09  The shell arithmetic now interprets C character constants.
01-04-09  A bug in which a non-zero return from a function defined
	  with the function reserved word did not trigger the ERR
	  trap or exit with set -e has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, in which characters above 127 were
	  not displayed correctly in vi or emacs edit mode has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, introduced in the 'k' point release, in
	  which the erase character in viraw mode was moving the cursor
	  to the left without erasing the character has been fixed.
01-04-02  On some systems the wcwith() function was returning a wrong
	  value for characters and caused characters to be displayed
	  incorrectly from the shell edit modes.  A work around for
	  this problem has been added. 
01-03-26  A bug in which valid scripts could produce syntax errors
	  when run with locales that considered characters such as "'"
	  to be space characters has been fixed.
01-03-20  A bug in which an syntax error in an arithmetic expression
	  entered interactively could cause the shell to go into
	  an infinite loop outputting the error message has been fixed.
01-03-10  ksh93 accepts -l as a synonym for -L in test on systems for
	  which /bin/test -l tests for symbolic links.
01-03-10  A bug in parsing scripts in which { and } are used in place of
	  in and esac in case statements embedded in compound commands
	  has been fixed.  Use of { and } for in and esac is obsolete.
01-03-06  A bug in which an argument of the form foo=bar was not
	  being passed correctly to a traced function whose name
	  was foo has been fixed.
01-03-02  Using $(trap -p name) did not print the name of the current
	  trap setting for trap name.
01-02-26  Exported floating point variables gave incorrect results
	  when passing them to ksh88.  This has been fixed.
01-02-25  A race condition in which a coprocess which completed too quickly
	  would not allow subsequent coprocesses to start has been fixed.
01-02-25  The 'g' format specifier is now handled by printf.  It had
	  inadvertently been omitted.
01-02-20  The + was not being displayed during an execution trace
	  with the += assignment operator.
01-02-19  The error message which occurs when the interpreter name
	  defined on the #! line does not exist is more informative.
01-02-19  A bug in which $0 would not be set correctly when a
	  script with #! was invoked by full pathname from the
	  directory of the script has been fixed.
01-02-19  A shell script did not always pick up tty mode changes
	  made by external commands such as stty which could
	  effect the behavior of read.
01-02-19  The -u, -g, and -k unary tests did not give the correct
	  results when used with negation and this has been fixed.

01-02-05  --- Release ksh93k+  ---
01-02-05  The sequence \&lt;newline&gt; inside $'...' was not incrementing
	  the line count and this has been fixed.
01-02-05  Modified expansion of "${@-}" so that if no arguments are set
	  it results in null string rather than nothing.
01-02-02  memory leak problem with local variables in functions fixed.
01-01-25  allow arithmetic expressions with float%int and treat them
	  as ((int)float)%int rather than as an error. 
01-01-19  read -n1 was not working and has been fixed.
01-01-17  ksh now handles the case in which a here document in command
	  substitution $() is terminated by the trailing ).  Previously,
	  a new-line was needed at the end of the delimiter word. 
01-01-02  A bug in which a KEYBD trap would cause a multi-line token
	  to be processed incorrectly has been fixed.
00-12-10  Arithmetic integer constants can now have L and U suffices. 
00-12-10  A bug in the processing of arithmetic expressions with compound
	  variables when the -n option is on has been fixed.

	  jobs run in a script has been fixed.
00-11-21  A bug in integer arrays in which the number of elements is
	  incorrect when the ++ operator is applied to a non-existing
	  element has been fixed.  For example, integer x; ((x&#0091;3&#0093;++)).
00-11-20  A timing bug in which the shell could reset the terminal
	  group to the wrong value in the case that the a new process
	  changes the terminal group during startup has been fixed.

00-10-27  --- Release ksh93k  ---
00-10-27  Using tab for completion now works only when applied
	  after a non-blank character at the end of the current line.
	  In other case a tab is inserted.
00-10-27  A bug in the emacs edit mode for ^X^E has been fixed.
	  The ^X^E sequence is supposed to invoke the full editor
	  on the current command.
00-10-18  A bug in which expansions of the form ${var//pattern/string}
	  did not work correctly when pattern was '/' or "/" has
	  been fixed.
00-10-18  The output format for indexed arrays in compound variables
	  has been modified so that it can be used as input.
00-10-18  Assignments with name references (typeset -n) will now
	  implicitly unreference an existing name reference.
00-10-17  A bug the += append operator when a single array element
	  is appended to a variable that is not an array has been fixed.
00-10-16  A bug in which the SIGCONT signal was being sent to
	  each process will kill -0 or kill -n 0 has been fixed.
00-10-12  The arithmetic evaluation portion has been rewritten to
	  perform a number of optimizations.

00-09-12  A bug in which multibyte characters would be displayed incorrectly
	  has been fixed.
00-08-08  Removed build dependency on iswprint() and iswalph().
00-07-20  In some cases the read builtin would read more than a single
	  line from a pipe on standard input and therefore leave the seek
	  position in the wrong location.
00-07-05  If the directory / is on the path, a / will not be inserted
	  between the directory and the file name during path searching
	  to avoid searching // for systems that treat this specially.
00-06-26  A bug in which on rare occasions wait could return before all
	  jobs have completed has been fixed.

00-05-09  Modified command substitution to avoid using /tmp files when
          run on read-only file systems. 
00-04-17  Modified printf to handle '%..Xc' and '%..Xs' options where X
	  is not an alpha character.  Previous versions core dumped with this.
00-04-10  Changes to multibyte editing code were made to use standard
	  ISO C functions rather than methods devised before the standard.
00-04-09  Add %H options to printf to output strings with &lt;"'&amp;\t&gt; properly
	  converted for use in HTML and XML documents.
00-04-07  Modified getopts builtin to handle <.>..</.>< >in usage string</ >
	  by invoking specified function.
00-04-04  Added self generating man pages for bg, fc, fg, disown, jobs,
	  hist, let, ., and ulimit.

	  type arguments would terminate the invoking script  has
	  been fixed.
00-03-27  A bug in which the library path variable was not updated  
	  correctly on some systems as described in the 'g' point
	  release has been fixed. 
00-03-07  printf now returns a non-zero exit status when one of
          its arguments cannot be converted to the given type. 
00-03-05  The return value and error message for a command that
          was found on the path but was not executable was set
          incorrectly.
00-03-05  A prototype for ioctl() was removed from the vi edit mode.

00-01-28  --- Release ksh93i  ---
00-01-28  Most of the built-in commands and ksh itself are now
          self documenting.  Running command --man will produce
          screen output.  Running command --html produces the
          man page in html format.
00-01-28  The getopts builtin can process command description
          strings to produce man pages.
00-01-28  A bug in which a script could terminate when getopts
          encountered an error when invoked inside a function
          has been fixed.
00-01-28  When a symbolic link was specified as the name of
          the script to invoke by name, the value of $0 was

	* diff,diff3,sdiff : use negative indices to avoid non-ascii case dups

Wed Jul 19 16:01:22 2000  Glenn Fowler <SMALL>&lt;<A href=mailto:gsf@research.att.com>gsf@research.att.com</A>&gt;</SMALL>

	* diff3 : call execvp() instead of execve()

Sat Oct  1 05:24:19 1994  Paul Eggert  <SMALL>&lt;<A href=mailto:eggert@twinsun.com>eggert@twinsun.com</A>&gt;</SMALL>

	* sdiff.c (expand_name): Likewise.
	(private_tempnam): Use tmpnam if HAVE_TMPNAM; this simplifies porting.
	(exists, letters): Omit if HAVE_TMPNAM.

	* diff3.c (read_diff): If STAT_BLOCKSIZE yields zero,
	adjust it to a more reasonable value.

Sat Sep 24 20:36:40 1994  Paul Eggert  <SMALL>&lt;<A href=mailto:eggert@twinsun.com>eggert@twinsun.com</A>&gt;</SMALL>

	* sdiff.c (exists, private_tempname): Adopt latest GNU libc algorithm.

	* configure.in (AC_ARG_PROGRAM): Added.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Add &#0091;date &gt; stamp-h&#0093;.

	(install, uninstall): Use it.
	(binprefix): Removed.
	(distfiles): Add stamp-h.in.
	(clean): Clean stamp-h.
	(config.hin, config.h): Use time stamp files.
	(cmp_o): Add $(LIBOBJS).
	(install): Install info files from srcdir if they're not in `.'.

	* cmp.c, io.c (word): Don't define if already defined.

	* comp.c (main): Use setmode, not open(..., O_BINARY); this gets stdin.
	Use NULL_DEVICE instead of "/dev/null".
	(cmp): Use %lu instead of %ld when it is more likely to be right.

	* diff.h (PR_FILE_NAME): Rename to PR_PROGRAM and move to Makefile.in,
	util.c.

	* diff3.c (main): Give proper diagnostic if too many labels were given.
	(read_diff): Use SYSTEM_QUOTE_ARG.

	namespace contamination.
	(main): Use SYSTEM_QUOTE_ARG.
	(private_tempnam): Don't access "/tmp" directly; use PVT_tmpdir.

Tue Sep 13 18:46:43 1994  Paul Eggert  <SMALL>&lt;<A href=mailto:eggert@twinsun.com>eggert@twinsun.com</A>&gt;</SMALL>

	* configure.in (AC_FUNC_MEMCHR): Remove.  Autoconf didn't adopt this,
	since we need not worry about an old experimental library
	where memchr didn't work.
	(AC_FUNC_MEMCMP): Not needed, since we only test for equality.
	(AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add test for memchr.
	(AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Check for memchr, not memcpy, since it'll be cached.

	* system.h (memcmp): Define in terms of bcmp.
	Use HAVE_MEMCHR to test for all mem* routines.

	* Makefile.in (srcs): Remove memcmp.c.
	We use bcmp if memcmp doesn't work, since we only test for equality.

Mon Sep 12 15:52:22 1994  Paul Eggert  <SMALL>&lt;<A href=mailto:eggert@twinsun.com>eggert@twinsun.com</A>&gt;</SMALL>

	macros when suitable.
	* memcmp.c: New file.
	* Makefile.in (CPPFLAGS, DEFS, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, prefix, exec_prefix):

	(srcs): Add memcmp.c.
	(distfiles): Rename config.h.in-&gt;config.hin, install.sh-&gt;install-sh.
	(Makefile, config.h, config.hin, config.status): Rework for
	compatibility with Autoconf 2.
	* io.c (binary_file_p): Assume non-broken memchr.
	* memchr.c: Assume compiler understands void *; otherwise
	we don't match GCC's internal declaration of memchr.
	* system.h: Use more modern autoconf approach to standard C headers.
	* version.c: Include &lt;config.h&gt;, not "config.h".

	* diff.c, diff.h (ignore_some_line_changes):
	New variable; replaces `length_varies'.
	(line_end_char): Replace with '; it wasn't being used consistently.

	* io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): Fix inconsistencies with -b -w -i and
	incomplete lines.  Put incomplete lines into their own bucket.
	This means line_cmp no longer needs line length arguments,
	and equivalence classes' line lengths no longer need to include 
	Invoke line_cmp only if ignore_some_line_changes.
	(prepare_text_end): -B no longer ignores missing newlines.
	(read_files): Allocate another bucket for incomplete lines.

	* util.c (line_cmp): Now takes just two arguments.  No longer
	optimizes for common case of exact equality; the caller does that
	optimization now.  The caller is changed accordingly.
	Optimize for the common case of mostly equality.
	Use isupper+tolower instead of islower+toupper, for consistency.

	* waitpid.c (waitpid): Fix typo with internal scoping.

Thu Sep  8 08:23:15 1994  Paul Eggert  <SMALL>&lt;<A href=mailto:eggert@twinsun.com>eggert@twinsun.com</A>&gt;</SMALL>

	* configure.in: Switch to new autoconf names.  Add sys/file.h test.
	* Makefile.in (distclean): Clean config.cache, config.log
	(used by new autoconf).

	* diff.c, diff3.c, (main), sdiff.c (trapsigs): If we'll have children,
	make sure SIGCHLD isn't ignored.

	* diff3.c (DIFF_CHUNK_SIZE): Removed.  Get size from STAT_BLOCKSIZE.
	(INT_STRLEN_BOUND): New macro.

	* ifdef.c (format_group, groups_letter_value):
	Use * instead of &#0091;&#0093; in prototypes.

	(main, usage, compare_files): Support --binary option.
	(compare_files): Use filename_lastdirchar to find last
	directory char in a file name.
	* cmp.c (main), diff.c (compare_files), dir.c (compare_names,
	diff_dirs): Use filename_cmp to compare file names.
	Use same_file to determine whether two files are the same.

Fri Jun 17 05:37:52 1994  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	collision with Unicos 8.0 &lt;sys/types.h&gt;, which also typedefs `word'.

Thu Apr 15 00:53:01 1994  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff3.c (scan_diff_line), util.c (print_number_range): Don't
	rely on promotion to make the old-style parameter type agree

	(READNUM): Ensure isdigit argument isn't negative.

Wed Sep 14 07:14:15 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* Version 2.4 released.

	* ifdef.c (scan_char_literal): New function, for new %c'x' and
	%c'\ooo' format specs.
	(format_group, print_ifdef_lines): Use it.  Remove %0 format spec.

	* cmp.c (cmp): Don't try to read past end of file; this doesn't
	work on ttys.

	* system.h, version.c: #include &lt;config.h&gt;, not "config.h", to allow
	configuring in a separate directory when the source directory has
	already been configured.
	* Makefile.in (COMPILE): New defn, with proper -I options so that
	`#include &lt;config.h&gt;' works.
	(.c.o, diff3.o, sdiff.o): Use it.

Mon Sep 13 06:45:43 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (main, longopts): Add --line-format=FORMAT option.
	(specify_format): Args no longer const pointers.  All callers changed.

	* ifdef.c: Add support for %?c, %(A=B?T:E), PRINTF_SPECn formats.
	(struct group): New struct.
	(print_ifdef_lines): Use it to simplify argument passing.
	Remove the convention that last arg -1 signifies that the lines
	from file 2 are the same as the lines from file 1; this
	convention no longer works, now that line numbers might be
	printed out, since the line numbers may differ.
	Add first FILE * argument to output to.  All callers changed.
	Use a faster test for the single-fwrite optimization.
	(format_group, scan_printf_spec, groups_letter_value): New functions.

	* diff.h (group_format, line_format): No longer const pointers.
	(format_ifdef): 1st arg is no longer const pointer.

	* configure.in: Configure HAVE_LIMITS_H, HAVE_STDLIB_H.
	* system.h &lt;limits.h&gt;, &lt;stdlib.h&gt;, &lt;string.h&gt;:
	Include only if HAVE_LIMITS_H etc.

	* system.h (memcmp, memcpy, strchr, strrchr, struct dirent): Prefer
	these standard names to the traditional names (bcmp, bcpy, index,
	rindex, struct direct).  All callers changed.

	* system.h (PARAMS, VOID):
	Define earlier so that malloc decl can use VOID.
	(STAT_BLOCKSIZE): Simplify ersatz defn; just use 8K.

Fri Sep  3 00:21:02 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (compare_files): Two files with the same name must be
	the same file; avoid a needless `stat' in that case.

Fri Aug 27 06:59:03 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* Pervasive changes for portability to 64-bit hosts:
	Add prototypes to function declarations.
	Use size_t, not int, when needed.

	* Other pervasive changes:
	Use `const' more often.
	Use STD{IN,OUT,ERR}_FILENO instead of &#0091;012&#0093;.
	Use 0, not NULL, for portability to broken hosts.

	* Makefile.in: (srcs, objs, distfiles, cmp): New files cmpbuf.&#0091;ch&#0093;.
	(distfiles): New files config.h.in, mkinstalldirs.
	(.c.o): Add -DHAVE_CONFIG_H.

	* analyze.c: (diag): Pacify `gcc -Wall' with a useless assignment.
	(diff_2_files): Use l.c.m., not max, of files' buffer sizes.

	* cmp.c: Make globals static when possible.

	(file): Now a 2-element array; replaces `file1' and `file2'.
	(file_desc, buffer): Likewise, for file&#0091;12&#0093;_desc and buf&#0091;12&#0093;.
	(main): Likewise, for stat_buf&#0091;12&#0093;.  Index these variables with `i'.

	(ignore_initial): New var.
	(long_options): Now const.  Add `--ignore-initial'.
	(usage): Sort options and add `--ignore-initial'.
	(main, cmp): Add `--ignore-initial' support.

	(main): `cmp - -' now succeeds.
	When comparing standard input to a file, and using a shortcut (e.g.
	looking at file sizes or inode numbers), take the lseek offset into
	account before deciding whether the files are identical.
	Avoid mentioning `dev_t', `ino_t' for portability to nonstandard hosts.
	Use l.c.m. of files' buffer sizes, not 8 * 1024.
	ferror (stdout) does not imply errno has a useful value.
	If 2nd file is "-", treat it first, in case stdin is closed.

	(cmp): Always compute `char_number', `smaller' for speed and simplicity.
	Say `cmp: EOF on input', not `/usr/gnu/bin/cmp: EOF on input',
	as per Posix.2.

	(block_compare_and_count): Increment line_number argument.
	Remove end_char argument; it's always '.  All callers changed.
	Do not assume sizeof(long) == 4; this isn't true on some 64-bit hosts.
	(block_compare): Minimize differences with block_compare_and_count.

	(block_read): Coalesce `bp += nread's.

	(printc): Remove `FILE *' arg; output to stdout.  All callers changed.

	* configure.in: Configure HAVE_SIGACTION, RETSIGTYPE, HAVE_VPRINTF.
	Configure into config.h.

	* context.c (print_context_label):
	Standard input's st_mtime is no longer a special case
	here, since `compare_files' now sets it to the current time.

	* diff.c (usage): Sort options.
	(filetype): New function.
	(compare_files): Set stdin's st_mtime to be the current time.
	Leave its name "-" instead of changing it to "Standard Input";
	to test whether a file is stdin, we must compare its name to "-" instead
	of its desc to 0, since if it's closed other file descs may be 0.
	When comparing standard input to a file, and using a shortcut (e.g.
	looking at file sizes or inode numbers), take the lseek offset into
	account before deciding whether the files are identical.
	Pretend that nonexistent files have the same filetype as existing files.
	Rename `errorcount' to `failed', since it's boolean.
	In directory comparisons, if a file is neither a regular file nor a
	directory, just print its type and the other file's type.

	* diff.h (Is_space, textchar): Remove.
	(struct msg, msg_chain, msg_chain_end): Move to util.c.
	(VOID): Move to system.h.
	(line_cmp, version_string, change_letter, print_number_range,
	find_change): New decls.

	whitespace -&gt; white space.  It now stands for whatever isspace yields.
	Add --ignore-initial.

	* diff3.c (VOID): Move to system.h.
	(version_string): Now char&#0091;&#0093;.
	(usage): Sort options.
	(process_diff): Pacify `gcc -Wall' with a useless assignment.
	(read_diff): pid is of type pid_t, not int.  Use waitpid if available.
	(output_diff3): Simplify test for `&nbsp;No newline at end of file' message.

	* dir.c (struct dirdata): Rename `files' to `names' to avoid confusion
	with external struct file_data `files'.

	* io.c (line_cmp): Move declaration to diff.h.
	(textchar): Remove.
	(find_and_hash_each_line): Use locale's definition of white space
	instead of using one hardwired defn for -b and another for -w.

	* normal.c (change_letter, print_number_range, find_change):
	Move decls to diff.h.
	(print_normal_hunk): Now static.

	* sdiff.c (SEEK_SET): Move to system.h.
	(version_string): Now char&#0091;&#0093;, not char*.
	(private_tempnam): Remove hardcoded limit on temporary file names.
	(exiterr, perror_fatal, main): When exiting because of a signal,
	exit with that signal's status.
	(lf_refill, main, skip_white, edit, interact): Check for signal.
	(ignore_SIGINT): Renamed from `ignore_signals'.
	(NUM_SIGS, initial_handler): New macros.
	(initial_action, signal_received, sigs_trapped): New vars.
	(catchsig, trapsigs): Use sigaction if possible, since this closes the
	windows of vulnerability that `signal' has.  Use RETSIGTYPE not void.
	When a signal comes in, just set a global variable; this is safer.
	(checksigs, untrapsig): New functions.
	(edit): Pacify `gcc -Wall' with a useless assignment.
	Respond to each empty line with help, not to every other empty line.
	(private_tempnam): Remove hardcoded limit on temporary file name length.
	Don't assume sizeof (pid_t) &lt;= sizeof (int).

	* system.h: (S_IXOTH, S_IXGRP, S_IXUSR,
	SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR,
	STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, STDERR_FILENO):
	New macros, if system doesn't define them.
	(volatile): Don't define if already defined.
	(PARAMS): New macro.
	(VOID): Move here from diff.h.

	* util.c (struct msg, msg_chain, msg_chain_end): Moved here from diff.h.
	(message5): New function.
	(pr_pid): New var.
	(begin_output): Allocate `name' more precisely.
	Put child pid into pr_pid, so that we can wait for it later.
	Don't check execl's return value, since any return must be an error.
	(finish_output): Detect and report output errors.
	Use waitpid if available.  Check pr exit status.
	(line_cmp): Use locale's definition of white space
	instead of using one hardwired defn for -b and another for -w.
	(analyze_cmp): Avoid double negation with `! nontrivial'.
	Pacify `gcc -Wall' be rewriting for-loop into do-while-loop.
	(dir_file_pathname): New function.

	* version.c (version_string): Now char&#0091;&#0093;, not char*.

Thu Jul 29 20:44:30 1993  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (config.status): Run config.status --recheck, not
	configure, to get the right args passed.

Thu Jul 22 10:46:30 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* Makefile.in (dist): Replace `if &#0091; ! TEST &#0093;; then ACTION; fi'
	with `&#0091; TEST &#0093; || ACTION || exit' so that the containing for-loop exits
	with proper status for `make'.

Thu Jul  8 19:47:22 1993  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (installdirs): New target.
	(install): Use it.
	(Makefile, config.status, configure): New targets.

Sat Jun  5 23:10:40 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (main): Cast args to compare_files, for traditional C.
	* side.c (print_sdiff_common_lines_print_sdiff_hunk): Likewise.
	* analyze.c, diff3.c, sdiff.c, util.c: Don't assume NULL is defined
	properly.

Tue May 25 14:54:05 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* analyze.c (diff_2_files):  With -q, do not report that files differ
	if all their differences are ignored.
	(briefly_report): New function.
	* diff.h (ignore_some_changes): New variable.
	* diff.c (compare_files): Don't use the file size shortcut if
	ignore_some_changes is nonzero, since the file size may differ
	merely due to ignored changes.
	(main):  Set ignore_some_changes if we might ignore some changes.
	Remove unsystematic assignment of 0 to static vars.
	* io.c (read_files): New argument PRETEND_BINARY says whether to
	pretend the files are binary.

	* diff3.c (tab_align_flag): New variable, for new -T option.

Sat May 22 15:35:02 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* Makefile.in (dist): Change name of package from diff to diffutils.
	Don't bother to build .Z dist; .z suffices.

	* diff.c: Include "system.h" to get memchr declaration.
	* system.h (memchr): Declare if !HAVE_MEMCHR, not if

	Don't define if already defined.

Fri Mar  5 00:20:16 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff.c (main): Use NULL in arg to compare_files.

Thu Feb 25 15:26:01 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* system.h: Declare memchr #if !HAVE_MEMCHR &amp;&amp; !STDC_HEADERS,
	not #if !HAVE_MEMCHR || !STDC_HEADERS.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Move complicated arg outside GUESS_LINES.

Mon Feb 22 12:56:12 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

Tue Feb  9 03:53:22 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (.c.o, diff3.o, sdiff.o): Put $(CFLAGS) last.

Wed Feb  3 15:42:10 1993  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

Tue Nov 24 10:06:48 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Note change from USG to HAVE_STRING_H.

Mon Nov 23 18:44:00 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): When running out of lines,
	double the number of allocated lines, instead of just doubling
	that number minus the prefix lines.  This is more likely to
	avoid the need for further memory allocation.

Wed Nov 18 20:40:28 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* dir.c (dir_sort): Plug memory leak: space holding directory
	contents was not being reclaimed.  Get directory size from
	struct file_data for initial guess at memory needed.
	Detect errors when reading and closing directory.
	(diff_dirs): Pass struct file_data to dir_sort.  Finish plugging leak.
	* diff.c (compare_files): Pass struct file_data to diff_dirs.

	* io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): Don't assume alloc_lines is

	* diff3.c (main, usage): Add -A or --show-all.
	-m now defaults to -A, not -E.  Allow up to three -L options.
	(output_diff3_edscript, output_diff3_merge):
	Remove spurious differences between these two functions.
	Output ||||||| for -A.  Distinguish between conflicts and overlaps.

	(output_diff3_edscript, output_diff3_merge): Use them.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): shift_boundaries needs an extra
	identical line at the end, not at the beginning.

	* sdiff.c (edit): execvp wants char **, not const char **.

Mon Oct 19 04:39:32 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* context.c (print_context_script, find_function): Context
	line numbers start with - file-&gt;prefix_lines, not 0.

	* diff3.c (main, make_3way_diff, using_to_diff3_block): Don't
	report bogus differences (for one of -mexEX3) just because the
	file0-file1 diffs don't line up with the file0-file2 diffs.
	(This is entirely possible since we don't use diff's -n
	option.)  Always compare file1 to file2, so that diff3 sees
	those changes directly.  Typically, file2 is now the common
	file, not file0.
	(output_diff3_merge): The input file is file 0, not the common file.

	(FC, FO): New macros; they replace FILE1, FILE0 for two-way diffs,
	to distinguish them from three-way diffs.

	* diff3.c (using_to_diff3_block): Fold repeated code into loops.

	* diff3.c (make_3way_diff, process_diff): Have the *_end
	variable point to the next field to be changed, not to the last
	object allocated; this saves an if-then-else.

	* diff3.c (process_diff): Use D_NUMLINES instead of its definiens.

	* diff3.c: Make fns and vars static unless they must be external.

Wed Sep 30 09:21:59 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	specified it, as opposed to its being the default.

Tue Sep 29 19:01:28 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (longopts, main): --{old,new,unchanged,changed}--group-format
	are new options, so that -D is no longer overloaded.  Set
	no_diff_means_no_output if --unchanged-{line,group}-format allows it.
	* diff.h (enum line_class): New type.
	(group_format, line_format): Use it to regularize option flags.
	All refs changed.

	* ifdef.c (format_ifdef, print_ifdef_lines): %n is no longer a format.

Mon Sep 28 04:51:42 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

Sun Sep 27 05:38:13 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (main): Add -E or --line-prefix option.  Add -D'=xxx'
	for common lines.  Change default -D&lt; format from copy of -D&gt;
	format to to -D&lt;%&lt;; similarly for default -D&gt; format.
	* diff.h (common_format, line_prefix): New variables.
	* ifdef.c (format_ifdef): New function.
	(print_ifdef_script, print_ifdef_hunk, print_ifdef_lines):
	Use it for -D'=xxx', -E.

	* context.c (find_hunk): Glue together two non-ignorable changes that
	are exactly CONTEXT * 2 lines apart.  This shortens output, removes
	a behavioral discontinuity at CONTEXT = 0, and is more compatible
	with traditional diff.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Slurp stdin at most once.

	* util.c (print_line_line): line_flag is const char *.

Thu Sep 24 15:18:07 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* ifdef.c (print_ifdef_lines): New function, which fwrites a sequence

	a hardwired format.

	* side.c (print_1sdiff_line): Represent incomplete lines on output.
	(print_sdiff_script): Likewise.  Don't print 'q' at end,
	since that doesn't work with incomplete lines.
	* sdiff.c (interact): Don't assume diff output ends with 'q' line.
	* diff.h (ROBUST_OUTPUT_STYLE): OUTPUT_SDIFF is now robust.

	* sdiff.c (lf_copy, lf_snarf): Use memchr instead of index,
	to avoid dumping core when files contain null characters.
	(memchr): New function (if memchr is missing).

	* io.c (sip): New arg SKIP_TEST to skip test for binary file.
	(read_files): Don't bother testing second file if first is binary.

Thu Sep 17 21:17:49 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* system.h &#0091;!USG &amp;&amp; !_POSIX_VERSION&#0093;: Protect from conflicting

	* configure.in: Add HAVE_MEMCHR.
	* diff.h, util.c: Use it instead of MEMCHR_MISSING.

Sun Sep  6 07:25:49 1992  Paul Eggert (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.h: (struct line_def): Replace this 3-word struct with char *.
	This uses less memory, particularly for large files with short lines.
	(struct file_data): New member linbuf_base counts number of lines
	in common prefix that are not recorded in linbuf;
	this uses less memory if files are identical or differ only at end.
	New member buffered_lines counts possibly differing lines.
	New member valid_lines counts valid data.
	New member alloc_lines - linbuf_base replaces old linbufsize.
	linbuf&#0091;0&#0093; now always points at first differing line.
	Remove unused members ltran, suffix_lines.
	Add const where appropriate.
	(Is_space): New macro, for consistent definition of `white space'.
	(excluded_filename, memchr, sip, slurp): New declarations.
	* ed.c (print_ed_hunk): Adjust to diff.h's struct changes.
	* context.c (pr_context_hunk): Likewise.
	* ifdef.c (print_ifdef_script): Likewise.
	* side.c (print_sdiff_script, print_half_line): Likewise.
	* util.c (analyze_hunk, line_cmp, print_1_line): Likewise.

	* analyze.c (shift_boundaries): Remove unneeded variable `end' and
	unnecessary comparisons of `preceding' and `other_preceding' against 0.
	(diff_2_files): When comparing files byte-by-byte for equality,
	don't slurp them all in at once; just compare them a buffer at a time.
	This can win big if they differ early on.
	Move some code to compare_files to enable this change.
	Use only one buffer for stdin with `diff - -'.
	(discard_confusing_lines, diff_2_files): Coalesce malloc/free calls.
	(build_script): Remove obsolete OUTPUT_RCS code.

	* diff.c (add_exclude, add_exclude_file, excluded_filename): New fns.
	(main): Use them for the new --exclude and --exclude-from options.
	(compare_files): Don't open a file unless it must be read.
	Treat `diff file file' and `diff file dir' similarly.
	Move some code here from diff_2_files to enable this.
	Simplify file vs dir warning.

	* dir.c (dir_sort): Support new --exclude* options.

	* io.c (struct equivclass): Put hash code and line length here instead
	of struct line_def, so that they can be shared.
	(find_and_hash_each_line): Compute equivalence class as we go,
	instead of doing it in a separate pass; this thrashes memory less.
	Make buckets realloc-able, since we can't preallocate them.
	Record one more line start than there are lines, so that we can compute
	any line's length by subtracting its start from the next line's,
	instead of storing the length explicitly.  This saves memory.
	Move prefix-handling code to find_identical_ends;
	this wins with large prefixes.
	Use Is_space, not is_space, for consistent treatment of white space.
	(prepare_text_end): New function.
	(find_identical_ends): Move slurping here, so it's only done when
	needed.  Work even if the buffers are the same (because of `diff - -').
	Compare prefixes a word at a time for speed.
	(find_equiv_class): Delete; now done by find_and_hash_each_line.
	(read_files): Don't slurp unless needed.
	find_equiv_class's work is now folded into find_and_hash_each_line.
	Don't copy stdin buffer if `diff - -'.
	Check for running out of primes.
	(sip, slurp): Split first part of `slurp' into another function `sip'.
	`sip' sets things up and perhaps reads the first ST_BLKSIZE buffer to
	see whether the file is binary; `slurp' now just finishes the job.
	This lets diff_2_files compare binary files lazily.
	Allocate a one-word sentinel to allow word-at-a-time prefix comparison.
	Count prefix lines only if needed, only count the first file's prefix.
	Don't bother to count suffix lines; it's never needed.
	Set up linbuf&#0091;0&#0093; to point at first differing line.
	(binary_file_p): Change test for binary files:
	if it has a null byte in its first buffer, it's binary.
	(primes): Add more primes.

	* util.c (line_cmp): Use bcmp for speed.
	Use Is_space, not is_space, for consistent treatment of white space.
	(translate_line_number): Internal line numbers now count from 0
	starting after the prefix.
	(memchr): New function (if memchr is missing).

	* Makefile.in: Document HAVE_ST_BLKSIZE.  Link with wildmat.o.
	* system.h (STAT_BLOCKSIZE): New macro based on HAVE_ST_BLKSIZE.
	* configure.in: Add AC_ST_BLKSIZE.
	* wildmat.c: New file.

Fri Sep  4 01:28:51 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sdiff.c (xmalloc): Renamed from ck_malloc.  Callers changed.

Fri Jul 14 17:39:20 1989  Chris Hanson  (cph at kleph)

	* analyze.c: To make RCS work correctly on files that don't
	necessarily end in newline, introduce some changes that cause
	diffs to be sensitive to missing final newline.  Because
	non-RCS modes don't want to be affected by these changes, they
	are conditional on `output_style == OUTPUT_RCS'.

	newline" message.

	GNU General Public license.
	* diff3.c: Changed copyright header to conform with new GNU
	General Public license.
	* COPYING: Made a hard link to /gp/rms/COPYING.

Fri Feb 24 10:01:58 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (slurp): Leave 2 chars space at end of buffer, not one.

	Now -p to show C function name--Damned IEEE!
	Fatal error if context length spec'd twice.

	* ed.c (print_ed_hunk): Now special treatment only for lines containing
	precisely a dot and nothing else.  Output `..', end the insert,
	substitute that one line, then resume the insert if nec.

	* io.c (find_and_hash_lines): When backing up over starting context,
	don't move past buffer-beg.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Use sentinels to make the loops faster.
	If files are identical, skip the 2nd loop and return quickly.
	(slurp): Leave 1 char extra space after each buffer.

	* analyze.c (diff_2_files): Mention difference in final newlines.

Wed Jan 25 22:44:44 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	Cross-propagate inf&#0091;i&#0093;.dir_p sooner.

	Status now 1 if one file is a dir and the other isn't, etc.

Thu Nov  3 16:30:24 1988  Randall Smith  (randy at gluteus.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: Added a define for diff3 to define DIFF_PROGRAM.

	* util.c: Added hack to make sure that perror was not called with
	a null pointer.

	* diff.c: Changed S_IFDIR to S_IFMT in masking type of file bits
	out.

	* diff3.c: Included USG compatibility defines.

	wanted on System V).

	* ed.c, analyze.c, context.c: Shortened names to 12 characters for
	the sake of System V (too simple not to do).
