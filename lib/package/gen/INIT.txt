The INIT package is required by all other packages. It contains the
package command, support scripts, and utilities.

Source Package Installation Instructions:

  (1) Do not install packages as root/super-user. Although some components may
      have setuid executables, few must be owned by root. These are best
      changed manually when the security implications are understood.
  (2) Choose a package root directory and cd to it. This will be a local work
      area for all packages. See (9) for installing packages for public use.
  (3) Create the subdirectory lib/package/tgz and download all package archives
      into that directory. The package(1) command maintains the contents of this
      directory and deletes old archives as new ones are read in. Package
      delta archives require the most recent base, so manually removing files
      in this directory may invalidate future deltas.
  (4) If the bin/package command does not exist then manually read the INIT source package:
		gunzip < lib/package/tgz/INIT.YYYY-MM-DD.0000.tgz | tar xvf -
      If your system does not have tar(1) or gunzip(1) then download the ratz
      source package, compile it, and manually read the INIT source package:
		mkdir bin
		cp lib/package/tgz/ratz.YYYY-MM-DD.0000.c lib/package/tgz/ratz.c
		cc -o bin/ratz lib/package/tgz/ratz.c
		bin/ratz -lv < lib/package/tgz/INIT.YYYY-MM-DD.0000.tgz
  (5) Read all unread package archive(s):
		bin/package read
      Both source and binary packages will be read by this step.
  (6) Build and install; all generated files are placed under arch/$HOSTTYPE
      ($INSTALLROOT), where $HOSTTYPE is defined by the output of
      bin/package (with no arguments.) name=value arguments are supported; CC
      and CCFLAGS are likely candidates. The output is written to the terminal
      and captured in $INSTALLROOT/lib/package/gen/make.out:
		bin/package make
  (7) List make results and interesting errors from (6):
		bin/package results
      Run the regression tests:
		bin/package test
      List test results and errors:
		bin/package results test
  (8) When (6) or (7) complete run:
		bin/package use
      to get an interactive $SHELL that sets up the environment for using
      package binaries:
	  $HOSTTYPE	 the current host type
	  $PACKAGEROOT	 the root directory for all packages ($P)
	  $INSTALLROOT	 the installation root for the current host type ($A)
	  $PATH		 $INSTALLROOT/bin:$PACKAGEROOT/bin prepended
	  $VPATH	 a two level view; all building done in $INSTALLROOT
          DLL-MAGIC	 environment magic for locating package shared libraries
      From this shell you can run nmake in any directory under
      $INSTALLROOT/src and rebuild just that part. If $INSTALLROOT/bin/nmake
      does not exist then the script $PACKAGEROOT/bin/nmake runs mamake
      on Mamfile. nmake is open source - download ast-open or ast-make to
      simplify future builds or to make new or delta packages.
  (9) Once you are satisfied with a package its binaries can be installed in
      a public area by:
		bin/package install PACKAGE DIRECTORY
      and users can access the binaries by
		bin/package use DIRECTORY
      or by exporting the environment variable definitions listed by
		bin/package show use DIRECTORY
