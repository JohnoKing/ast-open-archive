The AT&T Software Technology ast-open package from AT&T Labs Research
contains all of the ast open source commands and libraries.  This
package is a superset of the following packages: ast-base ast-ksh; you
won't need these if you download ast-open.

Source Package Installation Instructions:

  (1) Do not install packages as root/super-user. Although some components may
      have setuid executables, few must be owned by root. These are best
      changed manually when the security implications are understood.
  (2) Choose a package root directory and cd to it. This will be a local work
      area for all packages. See (9) for installing packages for public use.
  (3) Create the subdirectory lib/package/tgz and download all package archives
      into that directory. The package(1) command maintains the contents of this
      directory and deletes old archives as new ones are read in. Package
      delta archives require the most recent base, so manually removing files
      in this directory may invalidate future deltas.
  (4) If the bin/package command does not exist then manually read the INIT
      source package:
		gunzip < lib/package/tgz/INIT.YYYY-MM-DD.tgz | tar xvf -
      If your system does not have tar(1) or gunzip(1) then download the ratz
      source package, compile it, and manually read the INIT
      source package:
		mkdir bin
		cp lib/package/tgz/ratz.YYYY-MM-DD.c lib/package/tgz/ratz.c
		cc -o bin/ratz lib/package/tgz/ratz.c
		bin/ratz -lm < lib/package/tgz/INIT.YYYY-MM-DD.tgz
  (5) Read all unread package archive(s):
		bin/package read
      Both source and binary packages will be read by this step.
  (6) Build and install; all generated files are placed under arch/$HOSTTYPE
      ($INSTALLROOT), where $HOSTTYPE is defined by the output of
      bin/package (with no arguments.) name=value arguments are supported; CC
      and CCFLAGS are likely candidates. The output is written to the terminal
      and captured in $INSTALLROOT/lib/package/gen/make.out:
		bin/package make
  (7) List make results and interesting errors from (6):
		bin/package results
      Run the regression tests:
		bin/package test
      List test results and errors:
		bin/package results test
  (8) Run the binaries by
		export PATH=$INSTALLROOT/bin:$PATH
		ksh
      or by adding $INSTALLROOT/lib to the runtime linker search list
      (the variable that is assigned the value ../lib in the
      $INSTALLROOT/bin/.paths file.) If you want to build individual
      components run:
		bin/package use
      to get an interactive $SHELL that sets up the environment for using
      package binaries:
	  $HOSTTYPE	 the current host type
	  $PACKAGEROOT	 the root directory for all packages ($P)
	  $INSTALLROOT	 the installation root for the current host type ($A)
	  $PATH		 $INSTALLROOT/bin:$PACKAGEROOT/bin prepended
	  $VPATH	 a multi-level view; all building done in $INSTALLROOT
          DLL-MAGIC	 environment magic for locating package shared libraries
      From this shell you can run nmake in any directory under
      $INSTALLROOT/src and rebuild just that part. If $INSTALLROOT/bin/nmake
      does not exist then use $INSTALLROOT/bin/mamake on Mamfile.
      nmake is open source - download ast-open or ast-base to
      simplify future builds or to make new or delta packages.
  (9) Once you are satisfied with a package its binaries can be installed in
      a public area by:
		bin/package install DIRECTORY PACKAGE
      or you can just copy the entire $INSTALLROOT directory tree. Users can
      run the binaries by
		export PATH=DIRECTORY/bin:$PATH
		ksh
      or by adding DIRECTORY/lib to the runtime linker search list.

	  builtin to terminate prematurely has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which the shell could core dump if getopts was called
	  when the OPTIND variable contained a negative value has been fixed. 
02-06-10  The edit mode prompt has been modified to hande escape sequences.  
02-06-10  A bug which occured for interactive shells in which the builtin

02-06-10  A bug in which the trap on ERR was not being processed when
	  set inside a function has been fixed.
02-06-07  A bug in which function definitions could cause the history count

02-05-01  A bug in the emacs edit mode which occured in versions compiled
	  for multibyte character sets which occurred when a repeated search
	  was requested after a long line had been returned for the previous
	  search has been fixed.
02-04-02  vi and emacs edit modes were modified so that tab completion is
	  disabled when invoked from the read built-in.

02-03-26  --- Release ksh93m+  ---
02-03-26  A bug in which \ was not handled correctly when used in file
	  expansion has been fixed.
02-02-18  A bug in which lines beginning with a # were deleted from here

02-01-07  Added here documents of the form <<< word (as per zsh) which
	  is equivalent to << delim\nword\ndelim.

	  substitution of the form ${word op pattern} occured in the
	  same word has been fixed.
02-01-07  A compilation option, CMDLIB_BLTIN in the file OPTION, has
	  been added.  When this options is set, all commands implemented
	  in libcmd become shell builtin commands by default.
02-01-07  A bug in which builtin foo, where foo is already a builtin
	  would result in the builtin foo getting removed has been fixed. 
02-01-07  A bug which the shell executed a command found in the current
	  directory when PATH have no valid directories has been fixed.
01-11-28  The value of $? was not being set when called with exit.
01-11-28  If the last command was of the form (...) and a trap on EXIT or
	  ERR was set, and the command inside () modified the trap, then
	  the original trap wasn't executed.
01-11-26  The value for 0 is now preceded by the base number when
	  the base was not 10.
01-11-26  The default has compilation mode has been changes so that
	  viraw mode will always be on.

01-10-31  --- Release ksh93m  ---
01-10-31  A for loop optimizer bug for subshells contained withing for
	  loops has been fixed.
01-10-16  typeset without arguments no longer outputs variable names
	  that do not have any attributes that are set.
01-10-16  A bug introduced in ksh93l in which assignments specified with
	  the exec built-in were not being expanded properly has been
	  fixed.
01-10-11  An optimization bug in which ${!x) was treated as invariant in
	  a for loop has been fixed.
01-10-11  Unsigned integer variables in bases other than 10 are printed now
	  expand in that base with the base prefix.
01-10-10  A number of typos in the self generating man pages for shell
	  built-ins have been fixed.
01-10-04  The self generated man pages for hist and fc were not working
	  correctly and have been fixed.
01-10-03  Yet another optimizer bug in which shell patterns were
	  treated as invariants has been fixed.
01-09-27  Two bugs relating to multibyte history searches and to find
	  have been fixed.
01-09-27  A bug introduced in ksh93k in which the PATH searching was
	  not restored after running a command with an assignment list 
	  has been fixed.
01-09-26  A bug in which a zero filled field was treated as octal when
	  converted to integer has been fixed.
01-09-26  Yet another bug in the optimization of for loops related to
	  recursive functions with break or continue statements has been fixed.
01-09-25  The exponentiation operator ** was added to the shell arithmetic
	  evaluation.  It has higher precedence than * and is left
	  associative.
01-09-25  The code was modified to use the ast multibyte macros
	  and functions for handing multibyte locales.
01-09-25  The expansion ${parameter:offset:length} now handles negative
	  offsets which cause offsets to be measured from the end.
01-09-25  Some spelling errors in the documentation were corrected.
01-09-24  The /dev/tcp/host/port and /dev/udp/host/port now allow
	  the ports to be specified by service name. 
01-09-24  The change staring with ksh93g in which the the appropriate
	  library path variable is prepended with a corresponding library
	  directory has been modified.  With the new method, only the
	  library path defined in the file named .paths in the directory
	  where the executable is found will be modified.  See the
	  man page for more details.
01-09-23  The .fpath file (see ksh93h) is no longer looked for in each
	  directory on the path to locate function directories.  The
	  file named .paths is used instead.
01-09-23  A bug in which IFS was not being restored after being changed in
	  a subshell has been fixed.
01-09-16  With the vi and emacs edit modes, after a list of command
	  or functions is generated with = or M-= respectively,
	  any element from the list can be pasted on the command line
	  by preceding the = or M-= with a numeric parameter specifying
	  the position on the list.
01-09-16  A bug in ksh93l caused command completion not to find aliases
	  and functions.  Command listing from the edit mode was presented
	  in reverse order.  This has been fixed.
01-09-13  Another bug in the optimization of for loops related to subshells
	  when traps were set has been fixed.
01-09-07  A change in ksh93l caused brace expansion to stop working
	  and this has been fixed.
01-09-04  A bug introduced in ksh93k in which an arithmetic statement
	  within a function that used name references did not follow the
	  reference has been fixed.
01-09-04  A bug introduced in ksh93l in which export -p did not prefix
	  each export with the word export has been fixed.
01-08-29  A bug in multibyte input which occurred when a partial multibyte
	  character was received has been fixed.
01-08-29  A bug introduced in ksh93l which could cause a core dump
	  when an assignment list containing PATH is specified inside
	  command substitution has been fixed.
01-08-09  Another bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  errors in recursive functions using local variables that
	  contained for loops has been fixed.
01-07-27  A bug in which IFS would be unset after a command substitution
	  inside a here document has been fixed.
01-07-26  To conform to the POSIX standard, if you invoked ksh name,
	  and name does not contain a /,  it will first try to run
	  one in the current directory whether it is executable or not
	  before doing a path search for an executable script.  Earlier
	  versions first checked for an executable script using the
	  PATH variable.
01-07-23  A bug in which unset -f invoked in a subshell could unset a
	  function defined in the parent has been fixed.
01-07-16  A bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  name references to be treated as invariants has been fixed.
01-07-09  A bug in which a discipline function applied to a local variable
	  could cause a shell exception has been fixed.  Discipline
	  functions can only be specified for global variables. 

01-06-18  --- Release ksh93l  ---
01-06-18  A bug in assigning integers larger than can be represented as
	  long integers to floating point variables has been fixed.
01-06-18  A bug in the handling of unsigned integers (typeset -ui) has
	  been fixed.
01-06-04  The evaluation of the PS1 prompt no longer effects the value
	  of the $? variable.
01-06-01  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-22  A bug in which attributes for variables that did not have
	  values would be lost after a subshell has been fixed.
01-05-22  The %R format has been added to convert a shell pattern into
	  an extended regular expression.
01-05-22  The escape sequences \e, \cX, \C[.collating-element.], and
	  \x{hex} have been added to ASCII-C strings and to printf format
	  strings.
01-05-20  Patterns of the form {n}(pattern) and {m,n}(pattern) are now
	  recognized.  The first form matches exactly n of pattern whereas,
	  the second form matches from m to n instances of pattern.
01-05-20  The shell allows *-(pattern), +-(pattern),  ?-(pattern),
	  {m,n}-(pattern}, and @-(pattern) to cause the minimal
	  match of pattern to be selected whenever possible rather
	  than the maximal (greedy) match. 
01-05-20  The character class [:word:] has been added to patterns.
	  The word class is the union of [:alnum:] and the character _.
01-05-20  Inside (...) pattern groups, the \ character is now treated
	  specially even when in an enclosing character class.  The
	  sequences, \w, \d, \s are equivalent to the character classes
	  word, digit, and space respectively.  The sequences \W, \D,
	  and \S are their complement sets. 
01-05-20  The shell now recognizes pattern groups of the form
	  ~(options:pattern) where options or :pattern can be omitted.
	  Options use the letters + and - to enable and disable options
	  respectively.  The option letters g (greedy), i (ignore case)
	  are used to cause maximal matching and to cause case
	  insensitive matching respectively.  If :pattern is also
	  specified, these options are only in effect while this
	  pattern is being processed.  Otherwise, these options remain
	  in effect until the end of the pattern group that they are contained
	  in or until another ~(...) is encountered.  These pattern groups
	  are not counted with respect to group numbering.
01-05-14  When edit completion, expansion, or listing occurs in the
	  middle of a quoted string, the leading quote is ignored when
	  performing the completion, expansion, or listing.
01-05-14  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-10  A bug in which open files were not restored after a subshell
	  that had used exec to replace a file has been fixed. 
01-05-10  Redirection to a null file name now generates an error message. 
01-05-09  The shell now rejects some invalid parameter substitutions that
	  were previously processed in undefined ways.
01-05-09  A bug in which the output of select was not flushed before the
	  read when input did not come from the terminal has been fixed. 
01-05-08  A bug in which job ids would not be freed for interactive shells
	  when subshells ran built-ins in the background has been fixed.
01-05-08  The FPATH variable now requires an explicit . to cause the
	  current directory to be treated as a function directory. 
01-05-08  A bug in read -n when echo mode was disabled has been fixed.
01-05-07  A bug in which function definitions could be listed as part
	  of the history has been fixed.
01-04-30  This release uses a new and often much faster pattern matcher than
	  earlier releases.
01-04-30  An optimizer now eliminates invariant parameter expansions from
	  for while and until loops.
01-04-30  The variable .sh.match is set after each pattern match (# % or /)
	  in a variable substitution.  The variable .sh.match is an
	  indexed array with element 0 being the complete match. 
	  The array is only valid until the next subsequent pattern
	  match or until the value of the variable changes which ever
	  comes first.
01-04-30  A self generating man page has been added to shcomp.  Also,
	  shcomp now stops compiling when it finds an exit or exec
	  command and copies the remainder so that it can be used
	  for standard input.
01-04-30  The shcomp command was modified so that it can work in an
	  EBCIDIC environment and that binary scripts are portable
	  across environments.
01-04-30  A bug in the handling of a trailing : in PATH has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which the builtin version of a command would get invoked
	  even though the full pathname for the command was specified
	  has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which read would loose the last character when
	  reading the last line of a file that did not contain a new-line
	  character has been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which in vi mode the end of file
	  character and end of line character could be swapped has
	  been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which invoking a shell script that
	  did not have execute permission could set the exit value to
	  127 rather than 126 has been fixed.
01-04-20  A bug in which read -n from a pipe would block if fewer than
	  n characters was received has been fixed.
01-04-09  A bug in which invalid patterns, for example, ) by itself,
	  was not treated as a string has been fixed so that if i=')',
	  then [[ $i == $i ]] is true.
01-04-09  The shell arithmetic now interprets C character constants.
01-04-09  A bug in which a non-zero return from a function defined
	  with the function reserved word did not trigger the ERR
	  trap or exit with set -e has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, in which characters above 127 were
	  not displayed correctly in vi or emacs edit mode has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, introduced in the 'k' point release, in
	  which the erase character in viraw mode was moving the cursor
	  to the left without erasing the character has been fixed.
01-04-02  On some systems the wcwith() function was returning a wrong
	  value for characters and caused characters to be displayed
	  incorrectly from the shell edit modes.  A work around for
	  this problem has been added. 
01-03-26  A bug in which valid scripts could produce syntax errors
	  when run with locales that considered characters such as "'"
	  to be space characters has been fixed.
01-03-20  A bug in which an syntax error in an arithmetic expression
	  entered interactively could cause the shell to go into
	  an infinite loop outputting the error message has been fixed.
01-03-10  ksh93 accepts -l as a synonym for -L in test on systems for
	  which /bin/test -l tests for symbolic links.
01-03-10  A bug in parsing scripts in which { and } are used in place of
	  in and esac in case statements embedded in compound commands
	  has been fixed.  Use of { and } for in and esac is obsolete.
01-03-06  A bug in which an argument of the form foo=bar was not
	  being passed correctly to a traced function whose name
	  was foo has been fixed.
01-03-02  Using $(trap -p name) did not print the name of the current
	  trap setting for trap name.
01-02-26  Exported floating point variables gave incorrect results
	  when passing them to ksh88.  This has been fixed.
01-02-25  A race condition in which a coprocess which completed too quickly
	  would not allow subsequent coprocesses to start has been fixed.
01-02-25  The 'g' format specifier is now handled by printf.  It had
	  inadvertently been omitted.
01-02-20  The + was not being displayed during an execution trace
	  with the += assignment operator.
01-02-19  The error message which occurs when the interpreter name
	  defined on the #! line does not exist is more informative.
01-02-19  A bug in which $0 would not be set correctly when a
	  script with #! was invoked by full pathname from the
	  directory of the script has been fixed.
01-02-19  A shell script did not always pick up tty mode changes
	  made by external commands such as stty which could
	  effect the behavior of read.

	* cmp.c, io.c (word): Don't define if already defined.

	* comp.c (main): Use setmode, not open(..., O_BINARY); this gets stdin.
	Use NULL_DEVICE instead of "/dev/null".

	* diff.h (PR_FILE_NAME): Rename to PR_PROGRAM and move to Makefile.in,
	util.c.

Tue Sep 13 18:46:43 1994  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* configure.in (AC_FUNC_MEMCHR): Remove.  Autoconf didn't adopt this,
	since we need not worry about an old experimental library
	where memchr didn't work.
	(AC_FUNC_MEMCMP): Not needed, since we only test for equality.
	(AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add test for memchr.
	(AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Check for memchr, not memcpy, since it'll be cached.
	(AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Add string.h; regex.c uses on some old hosts.

	* system.h (memcmp): Define in terms of bcmp.
	Use HAVE_MEMCHR to test for all mem* routines.

	* Makefile.in (srcs): Remove memcmp.c.
	We use bcmp if memcmp doesn't work, since we only test for equality.

Mon Sep 12 15:52:22 1994  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CONFIG_HEADER): Rename config.h.in to config.hin.

	(srcs): Add memcmp.c.
	(distfiles): Rename config.h.in->config.hin, install.sh->install-sh.
	(Makefile, config.h, config.hin, config.status): Rework for
	compatibility with Autoconf 2.
	* io.c (binary_file_p): Assume non-broken memchr.

	we don't match GCC's internal declaration of memchr.
	* system.h: Use more modern autoconf approach to standard C headers.
	* version.c: Include <config.h>, not "config.h".

	* diff.c, diff.h (ignore_some_line_changes):
	New variable; replaces `length_varies'.
	(line_end_char): Replace with '\n'; it wasn't being used consistently.

	* io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): Fix inconsistencies with -b -w -i and
	incomplete lines.  Put incomplete lines into their own bucket.
	This means line_cmp no longer needs line length arguments,
	and equivalence classes' line lengths no longer need to include \n.
	Invoke line_cmp only if ignore_some_line_changes.
	(prepare_text_end): -B no longer ignores missing newlines.
	(read_files): Allocate another bucket for incomplete lines.

	* util.c (line_cmp): Now takes just two arguments.  No longer
	optimizes for common case of exact equality; the caller does that
	optimization now.  The caller is changed accordingly.
	Optimize for the common case of mostly equality.
	Use isupper+tolower instead of islower+toupper, for consistency.

	* waitpid.c (waitpid): Fix typo with internal scoping.

Thu Sep  8 08:23:15 1994  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	diff_dirs): Use filename_cmp to compare file names.
	Use same_file to determine whether two files are the same.
	* context.c (print_context_label): Check whether ctime yields 0.
	* diff3.c (read_diff), sdiff.c (cleanup, main, waitpid),
	util.c (begin_output): Use popen+pclose if !HAVE_FORK.

	collision with Unicos 8.0 <sys/types.h>, which also typedefs `word'.

Thu Apr 15 00:53:01 1994  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff3.c (scan_diff_line), util.c (print_number_range): Don't
	rely on promotion to make the old-style parameter type agree
	with the prototype parameter type; this doesn't work on

	producing suboptimal output for large inputs with many differences.
	(diff_2_files): Initialize it.
	(struct partition): New type.
	(SNAKE_LIMIT): New macro; merely documents already-used number 20.

	(main): Send version number to stdout, not stderr.
	(usage): Send usage to stdout, not stderr.
	(compare_files): Initialize `inf' properly.

	* io.c (word): Change to `int'; it makes a big difference on x86.
	(sip, slurp): Put off allocating room to hold the whole file until we
	have to read the whole file.  This wins if the file turns out
	to be binary.

	(memchr): Declare only if !HAVE_MEMCHR.  These changes are
	needed to keep some nonstandard hosts happy.

Sat Sep 18 01:33:07 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* configure.in (AC_STAT_MACROS_BROKEN): Add.

	* sdiff.c (xmalloc): Likewise.

	* ifdef.c (format_group): Ensure isdigit argument isn't < 0.

	* side.c (print_half_line): Use isprint, since some hosts lack isgraph.

	Define these before including any system headers,

	%c'\ooo' format specs.
	(format_group, print_ifdef_lines): Use it.  Remove %0 format spec.

	* cmp.c (cmp): Don't try to read past end of file; this doesn't

	configuring in a separate directory when the source directory has
	already been configured.
	* Makefile.in (COMPILE): New defn, with proper -I options so that
	`#include <config.h>' works.
	(.c.o, diff3.o, sdiff.o): Use it.

Mon Sep 13 06:45:43 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (main, longopts): Add --line-format=FORMAT option.
	(specify_format): Args no longer const pointers.  All callers changed.

	* ifdef.c: Add support for %?c, %(A=B?T:E), PRINTF_SPECn formats.
	(struct group): New struct.
	(print_ifdef_lines): Use it to simplify argument passing.
	Remove the convention that last arg -1 signifies that the lines
	from file 2 are the same as the lines from file 1; this
	convention no longer works, now that line numbers might be
	printed out, since the line numbers may differ.
	Add first FILE * argument to output to.  All callers changed.
	Use a faster test for the single-fwrite optimization.
	(format_group, scan_printf_spec, groups_letter_value): New functions.

	* diff.h (group_format, line_format): No longer const pointers.
	(format_ifdef): 1st arg is no longer const pointer.

	rindex, struct direct).  All callers changed.

	* system.h (PARAMS, VOID):
	Define earlier so that malloc decl can use VOID.
	(STAT_BLOCKSIZE): Simplify ersatz defn; just use 8K.

Fri Sep  3 00:21:02 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (compare_files): Two files with the same name must be
	the same file; avoid a needless `stat' in that case.

Fri Aug 27 06:59:03 1993  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* Pervasive changes for portability to 64-bit hosts:
	Add prototypes to function declarations.
	Use size_t, not int, when needed.

	* Other pervasive changes:
	Use `const' more often.
	Use STD{IN,OUT,ERR}_FILENO instead of [012].
	Use 0, not NULL, for portability to broken hosts.

	* Makefile.in: (srcs, objs, distfiles, cmp): New files cmpbuf.[ch].
	(distfiles): New files config.h.in, mkinstalldirs.
	(.c.o): Add -DHAVE_CONFIG_H.

	* analyze.c: (diag): Pacify `gcc -Wall' with a useless assignment.
	(diff_2_files): Use l.c.m., not max, of files' buffer sizes.

	* cmp.c: Make globals static when possible.

	(file): Now a 2-element array; replaces `file1' and `file2'.
	(file_desc, buffer): Likewise, for file[12]_desc and buf[12].
	(main): Likewise, for stat_buf[12].  Index these variables with `i'.

	(ignore_initial): New var.
	(long_options): Now const.  Add `--ignore-initial'.
	(usage): Sort options and add `--ignore-initial'.
	(main, cmp): Add `--ignore-initial' support.

	(main): `cmp - -' now succeeds.
	When comparing standard input to a file, and using a shortcut (e.g.
	looking at file sizes or inode numbers), take the lseek offset into
	account before deciding whether the files are identical.
	Avoid mentioning `dev_t', `ino_t' for portability to nonstandard hosts.
	Use l.c.m. of files' buffer sizes, not 8 * 1024.
	ferror (stdout) does not imply errno has a useful value.
	If 2nd file is "-", treat it first, in case stdin is closed.

	(cmp): Always compute `char_number', `smaller' for speed and simplicity.
	Say `cmp: EOF on input', not `/usr/gnu/bin/cmp: EOF on input',
	as per Posix.2.

	(block_compare_and_count): Increment line_number argument.
	Remove end_char argument; it's always '\n'.  All callers changed.
	Do not assume sizeof(long) == 4; this isn't true on some 64-bit hosts.
	(block_compare): Minimize differences with block_compare_and_count.

	(block_read): Coalesce `bp += nread's.

	(printc): Remove `FILE *' arg; output to stdout.  All callers changed.

	Configure into config.h.

	* context.c (print_context_label):
	Standard input's st_mtime is no longer a special case
	here, since `compare_files' now sets it to the current time.

	* diff.c (usage): Sort options.
	(filetype): New function.
	(compare_files): Set stdin's st_mtime to be the current time.
	Leave its name "-" instead of changing it to "Standard Input";
	to test whether a file is stdin, we must compare its name to "-" instead
	of its desc to 0, since if it's closed other file descs may be 0.
	When comparing standard input to a file, and using a shortcut (e.g.
	looking at file sizes or inode numbers), take the lseek offset into
	account before deciding whether the files are identical.
	Pretend that nonexistent files have the same filetype as existing files.
	Rename `errorcount' to `failed', since it's boolean.
	In directory comparisons, if a file is neither a regular file nor a
	directory, just print its type and the other file's type.

	* diff.h (Is_space, textchar): Remove.
	(struct msg, msg_chain, msg_chain_end): Move to util.c.
	(VOID): Move to system.h.
	(line_cmp, version_string, change_letter, print_number_range,

	Add --ignore-initial.

	* diff3.c (VOID): Move to system.h.
	(version_string): Now char[].
	(usage): Sort options.
	(process_diff): Pacify `gcc -Wall' with a useless assignment.
	(read_diff): pid is of type pid_t, not int.  Use waitpid if available.
	(output_diff3): Simplify test for `\ No newline at end of file' message.

	* dir.c (struct dirdata): Rename `files' to `names' to avoid confusion
	with external struct file_data `files'.

	* io.c (line_cmp): Move declaration to diff.h.
	(textchar): Remove.
	(find_and_hash_each_line): Use locale's definition of white space
	instead of using one hardwired defn for -b and another for -w.

	* normal.c (change_letter, print_number_range, find_change):
	Move decls to diff.h.
	(print_normal_hunk): Now static.

	* sdiff.c (SEEK_SET): Move to system.h.
	(version_string): Now char[], not char*.
	(private_tempnam): Remove hardcoded limit on temporary file names.
	(exiterr, perror_fatal, main): When exiting because of a signal,
	exit with that signal's status.
	(lf_refill, main, skip_white, edit, interact): Check for signal.
	(ignore_SIGINT): Renamed from `ignore_signals'.
	(NUM_SIGS, initial_handler): New macros.
	(initial_action, signal_received, sigs_trapped): New vars.
	(catchsig, trapsigs): Use sigaction if possible, since this closes the
	windows of vulnerability that `signal' has.  Use RETSIGTYPE not void.
	When a signal comes in, just set a global variable; this is safer.
	(checksigs, untrapsig): New functions.
	(edit): Pacify `gcc -Wall' with a useless assignment.
	Respond to each empty line with help, not to every other empty line.
	(private_tempnam): Remove hardcoded limit on temporary file name length.
	Don't assume sizeof (pid_t) <= sizeof (int).

	* system.h: (S_IXOTH, S_IXGRP, S_IXUSR,
	SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR,
	STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, STDERR_FILENO):
	New macros, if system doesn't define them.
	(volatile): Don't define if already defined.
	(PARAMS): New macro.
	(VOID): Move here from diff.h.

	* util.c (struct msg, msg_chain, msg_chain_end): Moved here from diff.h.
	(message5): New function.
	(pr_pid): New var.
	(begin_output): Allocate `name' more precisely.
	Put child pid into pr_pid, so that we can wait for it later.
	Don't check execl's return value, since any return must be an error.
	(finish_output): Detect and report output errors.
	Use waitpid if available.  Check pr exit status.
	(line_cmp): Use locale's definition of white space
	instead of using one hardwired defn for -b and another for -w.
	(analyze_cmp): Avoid double negation with `! nontrivial'.
	Pacify `gcc -Wall' be rewriting for-loop into do-while-loop.
	(dir_file_pathname): New function.

	* version.c (version_string): Now char[], not char*.

Thu Jul 29 20:44:30 1993  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (config.status): Run config.status --recheck, not

	(briefly_report): New function.
	* diff.h (ignore_some_changes): New variable.

	Don't define if already defined.

Fri Mar  5 00:20:16 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff.c (main): Use NULL in arg to compare_files.

Thu Feb 25 15:26:01 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* system.h: Declare memchr #if !HAVE_MEMCHR && !STDC_HEADERS,

	* Makefile.in: Note change from USG to HAVE_STRING_H.

Mon Nov 23 18:44:00 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): When running out of lines,
	double the number of allocated lines, instead of just doubling
	that number minus the prefix lines.  This is more likely to
	avoid the need for further memory allocation.

Wed Nov 18 20:40:28 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* dir.c (dir_sort): Plug memory leak: space holding directory
	contents was not being reclaimed.  Get directory size from
	struct file_data for initial guess at memory needed.
	Detect errors when reading and closing directory.
	(diff_dirs): Pass struct file_data to dir_sort.  Finish plugging leak.
	* diff.c (compare_files): Pass struct file_data to diff_dirs.

	* io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): Don't assume alloc_lines is

	* diff3.c (usage): Add third --label option in example.

	* util.c (analyze_hunk): Fix test for ignoring blank lines.

	* configure.in, system.h: Avoid USG; use HAVE_TIME_H etc. instead.

Mon Nov  9 05:13:25 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff3.c (main, usage): Add -A or --show-all.
	-m now defaults to -A, not -E.  Allow up to three -L options.
	(output_diff3_edscript, output_diff3_merge):
	Remove spurious differences between these two functions.
	Output ||||||| for -A.  Distinguish between conflicts and overlaps.
	(dotlines, undotlines): New functions that output `Ns', not `N,Ns'.
	(output_diff3_edscript, output_diff3_merge): Use them.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): shift_boundaries needs an extra
	identical line at the end, not at the beginning.

	* sdiff.c (edit): execvp wants char **, not const char **.

Mon Oct 19 04:39:32 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* context.c (print_context_script, find_function): Context
	line numbers start with - file->prefix_lines, not 0.

	* io.c (binary_file_p): Undo last change; it was a library bug.

Sun Oct 18 00:17:29 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (binary_file_p): Consider empty file as non-binary.

Mon Oct  5 05:18:46 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff3.c (main, make_3way_diff, using_to_diff3_block): Don't
	report bogus differences (for one of -mexEX3) just because the
	file0-file1 diffs don't line up with the file0-file2 diffs.
	(This is entirely possible since we don't use diff's -n
	option.)  Always compare file1 to file2, so that diff3 sees
	those changes directly.  Typically, file2 is now the common
	file, not file0.
	(output_diff3_merge): The input file is file 0, not the common file.

	(FC, FO): New macros; they replace FILE1, FILE0 for two-way diffs,
	to distinguish them from three-way diffs.

	* diff3.c (using_to_diff3_block): Fold repeated code into loops.

	* diff3.c (make_3way_diff, process_diff): Have the *_end
	variable point to the next field to be changed, not to the last
	object allocated; this saves an if-then-else.

	* diff3.c (process_diff): Use D_NUMLINES instead of its definiens.

	* diff3.c: Make fns and vars static unless they must be external.

Wed Sep 30 09:21:59 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* analyze.c (diff_2_files): OUTPUT_IFDEF is now robust.
	* diff.h (ROBUST_OUTPUT_STYLE): Likewise.
	(default_line_format): Remove.  All refs removed.

	* ifdef.c (print_ifdef_lines): Add %L.  Optimize %l\n even if user
	specified it, as opposed to its being the default.

Tue Sep 29 19:01:28 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (longopts, main): --{old,new,unchanged,changed}--group-format
	are new options, so that -D is no longer overloaded.  Set
	no_diff_means_no_output if --unchanged-{line,group}-format allows it.
	* diff.h (enum line_class): New type.
	(group_format, line_format): Use it to regularize option flags.
	All refs changed.

	* ifdef.c (format_ifdef, print_ifdef_lines): %n is no longer a format.

Mon Sep 28 04:51:42 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (main, usage): Replace --line-prefix with the more general
	--{old,new,unchanged}-line-format options.
	* ifdef.c (format_ifdef, print_ifdef_lines): Likewise.
	* diff.h (line_format): Renamed from line_prefix.  All refs changed.
	* diff.h, ifdef.c (default_line_format): New variable.
	* util.c (output_1_line): New function.
	(print_1_line): Use it.

	* ifdef.c: (format_ifdef, print_ifdef_lines): Add %0 format.

Sun Sep 27 05:38:13 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.c (main): Add -E or --line-prefix option.  Add -D'=xxx'
	for common lines.  Change default -D< format from copy of -D>
	format to to -D<%<; similarly for default -D> format.
	* diff.h (common_format, line_prefix): New variables.
	* ifdef.c (format_ifdef): New function.
	(print_ifdef_script, print_ifdef_hunk, print_ifdef_lines):
	Use it for -D'=xxx', -E.

	* context.c (find_hunk): Glue together two non-ignorable changes that
	are exactly CONTEXT * 2 lines apart.  This shortens output, removes
	a behavioral discontinuity at CONTEXT = 0, and is more compatible
	with traditional diff.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Slurp stdin at most once.

	* util.c (print_line_line): line_flag is const char *.

Thu Sep 24 15:18:07 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* ifdef.c (print_ifdef_lines): New function, which fwrites a sequence
	of lines all at once for speed.
	(print_ifdef_script, print_ifdef_hunk): Use it.

Thu Sep 24 05:54:14 1992  Paul Eggert  (eggert@twinsun.com)

	a hardwired format.

	* side.c (print_1sdiff_line): Represent incomplete lines on output.
	(print_sdiff_script): Likewise.  Don't print 'q' at end,
	since that doesn't work with incomplete lines.
	* sdiff.c (interact): Don't assume diff output ends with 'q' line.
	* diff.h (ROBUST_OUTPUT_STYLE): OUTPUT_SDIFF is now robust.

	* sdiff.c (lf_copy, lf_snarf): Use memchr instead of index,
	to avoid dumping core when files contain null characters.
	(memchr): New function (if memchr is missing).

	* io.c (sip): New arg SKIP_TEST to skip test for binary file.
	(read_files): Don't bother testing second file if first is binary.

Thu Sep 17 21:17:49 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	(usage): Document -x, -X, --exclude, --exclude-from.
	Makefile.in: Use fnmatch.c, not wildmat.c.

Sun Sep  6 23:46:25 1992  Paul Eggert (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* configure.in: Add HAVE_MEMCHR.
	* diff.h, util.c: Use it instead of MEMCHR_MISSING.

Sun Sep  6 07:25:49 1992  Paul Eggert (eggert@twinsun.com)

	* diff.h: (struct line_def): Replace this 3-word struct with char *.
	This uses less memory, particularly for large files with short lines.
	(struct file_data): New member linbuf_base counts number of lines
	in common prefix that are not recorded in linbuf;
	this uses less memory if files are identical or differ only at end.
	New member buffered_lines counts possibly differing lines.
	New member valid_lines counts valid data.
	New member alloc_lines - linbuf_base replaces old linbufsize.
	linbuf[0] now always points at first differing line.
	Remove unused members ltran, suffix_lines.
	Add const where appropriate.
	(Is_space): New macro, for consistent definition of `white space'.
	(excluded_filename, memchr, sip, slurp): New declarations.
	* ed.c (print_ed_hunk): Adjust to diff.h's struct changes.
	* context.c (pr_context_hunk): Likewise.
	* ifdef.c (print_ifdef_script): Likewise.
	* side.c (print_sdiff_script, print_half_line): Likewise.
	* util.c (analyze_hunk, line_cmp, print_1_line): Likewise.

	* analyze.c (shift_boundaries): Remove unneeded variable `end' and
	unnecessary comparisons of `preceding' and `other_preceding' against 0.
	(diff_2_files): When comparing files byte-by-byte for equality,
	don't slurp them all in at once; just compare them a buffer at a time.
	This can win big if they differ early on.
	Move some code to compare_files to enable this change.
	Use only one buffer for stdin with `diff - -'.
	(discard_confusing_lines, diff_2_files): Coalesce malloc/free calls.
	(build_script): Remove obsolete OUTPUT_RCS code.

	* diff.c (add_exclude, add_exclude_file, excluded_filename): New fns.
	(main): Use them for the new --exclude and --exclude-from options.
	(compare_files): Don't open a file unless it must be read.
	Treat `diff file file' and `diff file dir' similarly.
	Move some code here from diff_2_files to enable this.
	Simplify file vs dir warning.

	* dir.c (dir_sort): Support new --exclude* options.

	* io.c (struct equivclass): Put hash code and line length here instead
	of struct line_def, so that they can be shared.
	(find_and_hash_each_line): Compute equivalence class as we go,
	instead of doing it in a separate pass; this thrashes memory less.
	Make buckets realloc-able, since we can't preallocate them.
	Record one more line start than there are lines, so that we can compute
	any line's length by subtracting its start from the next line's,
	instead of storing the length explicitly.  This saves memory.
	Move prefix-handling code to find_identical_ends;
	this wins with large prefixes.
	Use Is_space, not is_space, for consistent treatment of white space.
	(prepare_text_end): New function.
	(find_identical_ends): Move slurping here, so it's only done when
	needed.  Work even if the buffers are the same (because of `diff - -').
	Compare prefixes a word at a time for speed.
	(find_equiv_class): Delete; now done by find_and_hash_each_line.
	(read_files): Don't slurp unless needed.
	find_equiv_class's work is now folded into find_and_hash_each_line.
	Don't copy stdin buffer if `diff - -'.
	Check for running out of primes.
	(sip, slurp): Split first part of `slurp' into another function `sip'.
	`sip' sets things up and perhaps reads the first ST_BLKSIZE buffer to
	see whether the file is binary; `slurp' now just finishes the job.
	This lets diff_2_files compare binary files lazily.
	Allocate a one-word sentinel to allow word-at-a-time prefix comparison.
	Count prefix lines only if needed, only count the first file's prefix.
	Don't bother to count suffix lines; it's never needed.
	Set up linbuf[0] to point at first differing line.
	(binary_file_p): Change test for binary files:
	if it has a null byte in its first buffer, it's binary.
	(primes): Add more primes.

	* util.c (line_cmp): Use bcmp for speed.
	Use Is_space, not is_space, for consistent treatment of white space.
	(translate_line_number): Internal line numbers now count from 0
	starting after the prefix.
	(memchr): New function (if memchr is missing).

	* Makefile.in: Document HAVE_ST_BLKSIZE.  Link with wildmat.o.
	* system.h (STAT_BLOCKSIZE): New macro based on HAVE_ST_BLKSIZE.
	* configure.in: Add AC_ST_BLKSIZE.
	* wildmat.c: New file.

Fri Sep  4 01:28:51 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sdiff.c (xmalloc): Renamed from ck_malloc.  Callers changed.

	* util.c, normal.c, io.c, ed.c, dir.c, diff.h, diff.c, context.c,
	analyze.c, Makefile: Changed copyright header to conform with new
	GNU General Public license.
	* diff3.c: Changed copyright header to conform with new GNU
	General Public license.
	* COPYING: Made a hard link to /gp/rms/COPYING.

Fri Feb 24 10:01:58 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (slurp): Leave 2 chars space at end of buffer, not one.
	(find_identical_ends): Special case if either file is empty;
	don't try to make a sentinel since could crash.

Wed Feb 15 14:24:48 1989  Jay Fenlason  (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff3.c (message)  Re-wrote routine to avoid using alloca()

Wed Feb 15 06:19:14 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Delete the variable `bytes'.

Sun Feb 12 11:50:36 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (slurp): ->bufsize is nominal amount we have room for;
	add room for sentinel when calling xmalloc or xrealloc.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Do need overrun check in finding suffix.

Fri Feb 10 01:28:15 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff.c (main): -C now takes arg to specify context length.
	Now -p to show C function name--Damned IEEE!
	Fatal error if context length spec'd twice.

	* ed.c (print_ed_hunk): Now special treatment only for lines containing
	precisely a dot and nothing else.  Output `..', end the insert,
	substitute that one line, then resume the insert if nec.

	* io.c (find_and_hash_lines): When backing up over starting context,
	don't move past buffer-beg.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Use sentinels to make the loops faster.
	If files are identical, skip the 2nd loop and return quickly.
	(slurp): Leave 1 char extra space after each buffer.

	* analyze.c (diff_2_files): Mention difference in final newlines.

Wed Jan 25 22:44:44 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* dir.c (diff_dirs): Use * when calling fcn ptr variable.

Sat Dec 17 14:12:06 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: New vars INSTALL and LIBS used in some rules;
	provide default defns plus commented-put defns for sysV.

Thu Nov 17 16:42:53 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* dir.c (dir_sort): Open-trouble not fatal; just say # files is -1.
	(diff_dirs): If dir_sort does that, give up and return 2.

	* diff.c (compare_files): Don't open directories.
	Don't close them specially either.
	Cross-propagate inf[i].dir_p sooner.

Sun Nov 13 11:19:36 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff.h: Declare index, rindex.

	* diff.c (compare_files): If comparing foodir with b/f,
	use foodir/f, not foodir/b/f.

	* diff.c (compare_files): Don't print "are identical" msg for 2 dirs.
	Status now 1 if one file is a dir and the other isn't, etc.

Thu Nov  3 16:30:24 1988  Randall Smith  (randy at gluteus.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: Added a define for diff3 to define DIFF_PROGRAM.

	* util.c: Added hack to make sure that perror was not called with
	a null pointer.

	* diff.c: Changed S_IFDIR to S_IFMT in masking type of file bits
	out.

	* diff3.c: Included USG compatibility defines.

	* diff.h: Moved sys/file.h into #else USG section (not needed or
	wanted on System V).

	* ed.c, analyze.c, context.c: Shortened names to 12 characters for
	the sake of System V (too simple not to do).
